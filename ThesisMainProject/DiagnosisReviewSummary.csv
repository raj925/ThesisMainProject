While diagnostic and technical skills are essential, an awareness of the extent and limits of our own knowledge and skills is critical. The present study examines clinicians’ subjective awareness in a diagnostic cardiac ultrasound task. Clinicians answered diagnostic and treatment related questions for a range of pathologies. Following these questions, clinicians indicated their level of confidence in their response. A comparison of response accuracy and confidence revealed that clinicians were generally overconfident in their responses. Critically, we observed that a clinician’s overconfidence was negatively correlated with prior experience: clinicians that had more prior experience expressed less overconfidence in their performance such that some clinicians were in fact underconfident.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether short-training-based dermoscopy increases confidence in the diagnosis of skin lesions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: After a 1-hour course on dermoscopy, 20 pairs of clinical and dermoscopic images of lesions were presented to 19 dermatology residents with little or no dermoscopy experience. After viewing the clinical image, they were asked to assess their confidence in the diagnosis in a seven-point scale, with 1 reflecting that the respondent was 100% confident that the lesion was benign, while number 7 reflected 100% confidence that it was malignant. The same technique was used for dermoscopic images. RESULTS: Ten of the 20 pairs of evaluations showed a significant difference (p<.05). The largest differences were observed in lesions where clinical scores suggested that participants were uncertain about the diagnosis, but tended to decide that the lesion was benign after dermoscopy. Dermoscopy did not improve confidence in the evaluation of dysplastic lesions as well as lesions with obvious clinical diagnoses.

"Leblanc, Vicki R.; Norman, Geoffrey R.; Brooks, Lee R.",Effect of a Diagnostic Suggestion on Diagnostic Accuracy and Identification of Clinical Features:,Academic Medicine,"The present study investigated whether the point at which a diagnosis is presented will influence identification of features and diagnostic accuracy. Medical students were shown head-and-shoulders photographs accompanied by short case histories and tentative diagnoses that biased them towards either the correct diagnoses or incorrect alternative diagnoses. Prior to reporting the clinical features or making any diagnostic decision in each case, they received the suggestion of a differential diagnosis (the correct one if initially biased towards the alternate one, and vice versa). If medical students attend to the early diagnosis only and ignore subsequent diagnostic suggestions, their diagnostic decisions and identification of features will favor the initially suggested diagnosis. However, if the students attend equally to diagnostic suggestions presented early and late in a clinical encounter, their diagnostic decisions and identification of features should not be influenced by the diagnosis that is suggested",2001,Yes,Scenarios with photographs with clinical features,,No,No,Yes,No,No,No (conclude to alternate diagnosis),No,Medical Students,No,,No,20,,Differential Information Intervention,Information Interpretation?,"Accuracy high when correct differential is considered early on, and then identified more correct clinical features consistent with it"

While research has examined visual search processes in other aspects of medical decision making (e.g., radiology), this is the first study to apply the paradigm to ECG interpretation. The secondary aim is to explore the role that clinical history plays in influencing visual search behavior and diagnostic decision making. While clinical history may aid diagnostic decision making, it may also bias the visual search process. Methods: Ten final-year medical students and 10 consultant emergency medics were presented with 16 ECG traces (8 with clinical history that was not manipulated independently of case) while wearing eye tracking equipment. The ECGs represented common abnormalities encountered in emergency departments and were among those taught to final-year medical students. Participants were asked to make a diagnosis on each presented trace and report their level of diagnostic confidence. Results: Experts made significantly faster, more accurate, and more confident diagnoses, and this advantage was underpinned by differences in visual search behavior. Specifically, experts were significantly quicker at locating the leads of critical importance. Contrary to our hypothesis, clinical history had no significant effect on the readers’ ability to detect the abnormality or make an accurate diagnosis.

We examined how the quality of contextual information influences decision making and how underlying perceptual-cognitive processes change as a function of experience and diagnostic accuracy. Twenty-one radiologists dictated their findings on 16 deidentified musculoskeletal radiographic cases while wearing a mobile-eye tracking system. Patient histories were mismatched on a subset of cases to be miscued relative to the correct diagnosis. Experienced radiologists outperformed less-experienced participants, but no systematic differences in gaze behaviors emerged between groups. Miscued case notes increased perceptual-cognitive bias in both groups, resulting in an approximate 40% decrease in diagnostic accuracy. Most errors were judgment errors, meaning participants visually fixated on the abnormality for longer than a second yet still failed to make the correct diagnosis. Findings suggest a physician’s confidence in their diagnosis might be misplaced after spending insufficient time extracting relevant information from key areas of the visual display, or when decisions are based primarily on a priori expectations derived from patient histories.

"Blissett, S.; Sibbald, M.; Kok, E.; van Merrienboer, J.",Optimizing self-regulation of performance: is mental effort a cue?,Advances in Health Sciences Education,"Accurate self-regulation of performance is important for trainees. Trainees rely on cues to make monitoring judgments to self-regulate their performance. Ideally, cues and monitoring judgements accurately reflect performance, as measured by cue diagnosticity (the ability of a cue to predict performance) and monitoring accuracy (the ability of a monitoring judgement to predict performance). However, this process is far from perfect, emphasizing the need for more accurate cues and monitoring judgements. Perhaps the mental effort of a task could be a cue used to inform certainty judgements. The purpose of this study is to measure cue utilization and cue diagnosticity of mental effort and monitoring accuracy of certainty for self-regulation of performance. Focused on the task of ECG interpretation, 22 PGY 1-3 Internal Medicine residents at McMaster University provided a diagnosis for 10 ECGs, rating their level of certainty (0–100%) and mental effort (Paas scale, 1–9). 220 ECGs completed by 22 participants were analyzed using path analysis. There was a negative moderate path coefficient between certainty and mental effort (_ = _ 0.370, p < 0.001), reflecting cue utilization. Regarding cue diagnosticity of mental effort, this was reflected in a small negative path coefficient between mental effort and diagnostic accuracy (_ = _ 0.170, p = 0.013). Regarding monitoring accuracy, a moderate path coefficient was observed between certainty and diagnostic accuracy (_ = 0.343, p < 0.001). Our results support mental effort as a cue and certainty as a monitoring judgement for self-regulated performance. Yet, reported correlations are not very high.

"Fernandez-Aguilar, Carmen; Martin-Martin, Jose Jesus; Minue Lorenzo, Sergio; Fernandez Ajuria, Alberto",Use of heuristics during the clinical decision process from family care physicians in real conditions.,Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,"RATIONALE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The available evidence on the use of heuristics and their relationship with diagnostic error in primary care is very limited. The aim of the study is to identify the use of unknown thought and specifically the possible use of Representativeness, Availability and overconfidence heuristics in the clinical practice of primary care physicians in cases of dyspnoea and to analyse their possible relationship with diagnostic error., METHODS: A total of 371 patients consulting with new episodes of dyspnoea in Primary Care centres in Spain were registered. Based on specific operational definitions, the use of unconscious thinking and the use of heuristics during the diagnostic process were assessed. Subsequently, the association between their use and diagnostic error was analysed., RESULTS: In 49.6% of cases, the confirmatory diagnosis coincided with the first diagnostic impression, suggesting the use of the representativeness heuristic in the diagnostic decision process. In 82.3% of the cases, the confirmatory diagnosis was among the three diagnostic hypotheses that were first identified by the general physicians, suggesting a possible use of the availability heuristic. In more than 50% of the cases, the physicians were overconfident in the certainty of their own diagnosis. Finally, a diagnostic error was identified in 9.9% of the recorded cases and no statistically significant correlation was found between the use of some unconscious thinking tools (such as the use of heuristics) and the diagnostic error., CONCLUSION: Unconscious thinking manifested through the acceptance of the first diagnostic impression and the use of heuristics is commonly used by primary care physicians in the clinical decision process in the face of new episodes of dyspnoea; however, its influence on diagnostic error is not significant. The proposed explicit and reproducible methodology may inspire further studies to confirm these results. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

R.; Reincke, M.; Zwaan, L.; Schmidmaier, R.","Insights into diagnostic errors in endocrinology: a prospective, case-based, international study",BMC Medical Education,"Background: Diagnostic errors in internal medicine are common. While cognitive errors have previously been identified to be the most common contributor to errors, very little is known about errors in specific fields of internal medicine such as endocrinology. This prospective, multicenter study focused on better understanding the causes of diagnostic errors made by general practitioners and internal specialists in the area of endocrinology. Methods: From August 2019 until January 2020, 24 physicians completed five endocrine cases on an online platform that simulated the diagnostic process. After each case, the participants had to state and explain why they chose their assumed diagnosis. The data gathering process as well as the participants’ explanations were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed to determine the causes of the errors. The diagnostic processes in correctly and incorrectly solved cases were compared. Results: Seven different causes of diagnostic error were identified, the most frequent being misidentification (mistaking one diagnosis with a related one or with more frequent and similar diseases) in 23% of the cases. Other causes were faulty context generation (21%) and premature closure (17%). The diagnostic confidence did not differ between correctly and incorrectly solved cases (median 8 out of 10, p = 0.24). However, in incorrectly solved cases, physicians spent less time on the technical findings (such as lab results, imaging) (median 250 s versus 199 s, p < 0.049). Conclusions: The causes for errors in endocrine case scenarios are similar to the causes in other fields of internal medicine. Spending more time on technical findings might prevent misdiagnoses in everyday clinical practice. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,Yes,5 patient cases,1-10 confidence in diagnosis,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes but you can offer a diagnostic explanation which is basically a sentence ,No,Endocrinology,No,,No,24,,Imaging Increasing Confidence,,"Confidence did not differ between correct and incorrect, but incorrect cases were associated with less time spent on lab results and imaging "

It remains unclear, however, whether EHR indeed fulfills this claim under the severe time constraints of Emergency Departments (EDs). We assessed whether accessing EHR in an ED actually improves decision-making by clinicians. A simulated ED environment was created at the Israel Center for Medical Simulation (MSR). Four different actors were trained to simulate four specific complaints and behavior and 'consulted' 26 volunteer ED physicians. Each physician treated half of the cases (randomly) with access to EHR, and their medical decisions were compared to those where the physicians had no access to EHR. Comparison of diagnostic accuracy with and without access showed that accessing the EHR led to an increase in the quality of the clinical decisions. Physicians accessing EHR were more highly informed and thus made more accurate decisions. The percentage of correct diagnoses was higher and these physicians were more confident in their diagnoses and made their decisions faster. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",2015,Yes,Simulated patient scenarios with actors for presenting complaints,7 point likert scale of confidence in diagnosis,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No (but manipulated whether there was access to EHR),Emergency Medicine,No,,No,26,,Differential Information Intervention,,More confident and accurate with EHRs

Whilst the ECG is an important clinical tool, it is frequently incorrectly interpreted. Even expert clinicians are known to impulsively provide a diagnosis based on their first impression and often miss co-abnormalities. Given it is widely reported that there is a lack of competency in ECG interpretation, it is imperative to optimise the interpretation process. Predominantly the ECG interpretation process remains a paper based approach and whilst computer algorithms are used to assist interpreters by providing printed computerised diagnoses, there are a lack of interactive human-computer interfaces to guide and assist the interpreter. Methods An interactive computing system was developed to guide the decision making process of a clinician when interpreting the ECG. The system decomposes the interpretation process into a series of interactive sub-tasks and encourages the clinician to systematically interpret the ECG. We have named this model ‘Interactive Progressive based Interpretation’ (IPI) as the user cannot ‘progress’ unless they complete each sub-task. Using this model, the ECG is segmented into five parts and presented over five user interfaces (1: Rhythm interpretation, 2: Interpretation of the P-wave morphology, 3: Limb lead interpretation, 4: QRS morphology interpretation with chest lead and rhythm strip presentation and 5: Final review of 12-lead ECG). The IPI model was implemented using emerging web technologies (i.e. HTML5, CSS3, AJAX, PHP and MySQL). It was hypothesised that this system would reduce the number of interpretation errors and increase diagnostic accuracy in ECG interpreters. To test this, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians when they used the standard approach (control cohort) with clinicians who interpreted the same ECGs using the IPI approach (IPI cohort). Results For the control cohort, the (mean; standard deviation; confidence interval) of the ECG interpretation accuracy was (45.45%; SD = 18.1%; CI = 42.07, 48.83). The mean ECG interpretation accuracy rate for the IPI cohort was 58.85% (SD = 42.4%; CI = 49.12, 68.58), which indicates a positive mean difference of 13.4%. (CI = 4.45, 22.35) An N _ 1 Chi-square test of independence indicated a 92% chance that the IPI cohort will have a higher accuracy rate. Interpreter self-rated confidence also increased between cohorts from a mean of 4.9/10 in the control cohort to 6.8/10 in the IPI cohort (p = 0.06). Whilst the IPI cohort had greater diagnostic accuracy, the duration of ECG interpretation was six times longer when compared to the control cohort. Conclusions We have developed a system that segments and presents the ECG across five graphical user interfaces. Results indicate that this approach improves diagnostic accuracy but with the expense of time, which is a valuable resource in medical practice. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",2016,No,ECG interpretation,Self-rated confidence 1-10,Yes,No,No (closest is time spent on each ECG segment),Yes,Yes (GPs and undergrads),No (single),No,GPs and Undergrads,Yes (Years of experience),GPs to undergrads,Yes,31,Acute,Imaging Increasing Confidence,,Using designed interface for ECG improves accuracy but increases time spent looking at trace

Thirty-one (N = 31) first- to fourth-year pathology and dermatology residents were randomly assigned to one of the two scaffolding conditions. The cases used in this study were selected from the domain of nodular and diffuse dermatitides. Both groups worked with a version of SlideTutor that provided immediate feedback on their actions for 2 h before proceeding to solve cases in either the Considering Alternatives or Playback condition. No immediate feedback was provided on actions performed by participants in the scaffolding mode. Measurements included learning gains (pre-test and post-test), as well as metacognitive performance, including Goodman–Kruskal Gamma correlation, bias, and discrimination. Results showed that participants in both conditions improved significantly in terms of their diagnostic scores from pre-test to post-test. More importantly, participants in the Considering Alternatives condition outperformed those in the Playback condition in the accuracy of their confidence judgments and the discrimination of the correctness of their assertions while solving cases. The results suggested that presenting participants with their diagnostic decision paths and highlighting correct and incorrect paths helps them to become more metacognitively accurate in their confidence judgments. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2014,No,Dermatoligical slides,6 point scale confidence in correct diagnosis,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes (rated),Pathology / Dermatology,No,,No,31,,Decision Support / Cognitive Intervention,,"Asked to either consider alternatives or play back decisions (diagnostic paths), improves accuracy and calibration."

After each session the participants were asked to score their confidence on a scale of 1 to 10. At the end of the study, the results were compared between seniors and junior residents. Results: The median age of the participants was 29 years (24-34). Twenty (62.5%) of the residents were junior residents. There were no significant differences between the two resident groups in terms of accurate diagnosis rates, regardless of the clinical information (p=0.307 and p=0.061).

J.; Blanchard, R.",Accuracy screening for ST elevation myocardial infarction in a task-switching simulation,Western Journal of Emergency Medicine,"Introduction: Interruptions in the emergency department (ED) are associated with clinical errors, yet are important when providing care to multiple patients. Screening triage electrocardiograms (ECG) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) represent a critical interrupting task that emergency physicians (EP) frequently encounter. To address interruptions such as ECG interpretation, many EPs engage in task switching, pausing their primary task to address an interrupting task. The impact of task switching on clinical errors in interpreting screening ECGs for STEMI remains unknown. Methods: Resident and attending EPs were invited to participate in a crossover simulation trial. Physicians first completed a task-switching simulation in which they viewed patient presentations interrupted by clinical tasks, including screening ECGs requiring immediate interpretation before resuming the patient presentation. Participants then completed an uninterrupted simulation in which patient presentations and clinical tasks were completed sequentially without interruption. The primary outcome was accuracy of ECG interpretation for STEMI during task switching and uninterrupted simulations. Results: Thirty-five participants completed the study. We found no significant difference in accuracy of ECG interpretation for STEMI (task switching 0.89, uninterrupted 0.91, paired t-test p=0.21). Attending physician status (odds ratio [OR] [2.56], confidence interval [CI] [1.66-3.94], p<0.01) and inferior STEMI (OR [0.08], CI [0.04-0.14], p<0.01) were associated with increased and decreased odds of correct interpretation, respectively. Low self-reported confidence in interpretation was associated with decreased odds of correct interpretation in the task-switching simulation, but not in the uninterrupted simulation (interaction p=0.02). Conclusion: In our simulation, task switching was not associated with overall accuracy of ECG interpretation for STEMI. However, odds of correct interpretation decreased with inferior STEMI ECGs and when participants self-reported low confidence wh en interrupted.

Hospitalists caring for these patients are often multitasking when overseeing patient care. We aimed to measure hospitalist workload and understand its influences on diagnostic performance in a real-world clinical setting. Methods We conducted a single-center, prospective, pilot observational study of hospitalists admitting new patients to the hospital. Hospitalists completed an abridged Mindful Attention Awareness Tool and a survey about diagnostic confidence at shift completion. Data on differential diagnoses and resource utilization (e.g., laboratory, imaging tests ordered, and consultations) were collected from the medical record. The number of admissions and paging volume per shift were used as separate proxies for shift busyness. Data were analyzed using linear mixed effects models (continuous outcomes) or mixed effects logistic regression (dichotomous outcomes). Results Of the 53 hospitalists approached, 47 (89%) agreed to participate; complete data were available for 37 unique hospitalists who admitted 160 unique patients.

"Hillson, S.D.; Connelly, D.P.; Liu, Y.",The Effects of Computer-assisted Electrocardiographic Interpretation on Physicians' Diagnostic Decisions,Medical Decision Making,"Objective. To evaluate the effect of computer-assisted interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) on diagnostic decision making by primary care physicians. Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting. Primary care physicians' outpatient clinics in or near the Minneap olis/St. Paul metropolitan area. Participants. Forty family physicians and general internists who were members of either of two large consortia of clinics. Intervention. Subjects evaluated ten clinical vignettes accompanied by ECGs and reported their diagnostic impressions. The vignettes were based on actual patient visits. Half of the subjects received ECGs with computer-generated reports, the other half received the same ECGs without reports. Main outcome measures. ECG reading time; agreement with the clinical diagnosis; agreement with the computer report; diagnostic confidence. Results. The subjects receiving the reports were more likely to agree with the clinical diagnoses of the original cases, particularly for two vignettes in which the diagnoses were uncommon and were mentioned in the reports. The subjects receiving the reports were also more likely to make diagnoses that were consistent with the reports, even when the reports were erroneous. Those receiving the reports spent, on average, 15 seconds less time looking at each ECG, a 25% decrease. Conclusions. In simulated cases, primary care physicians appear to use computer interpre tations of ECGs when available, as shown by enhanced diagnostic accuracy and modestly reduced time spent reading the tracings. However, erroneous reports may mislead physi cians. Since the effects of computerized ECG interpretation do not appear to have been uniformly favorable in this mock-clinical setting, it will be important to evaluate the effects of this technology in actual practice.

"Staal, J.; Speelman, M.; Brand, R.; Alsma, J.; Zwaan, L.",Does a suggested diagnosis in a general practitioners’ referral question impact diagnostic reasoning: an experimental study,BMC Medical Education,"Background: Diagnostic errors are a major cause of preventable patient harm. Studies suggest that presenting inaccurate diagnostic suggestions can cause errors in physicians’ diagnostic reasoning processes. It is common practice for general practitioners (GPs) to suggest a diagnosis when referring a patient to secondary care. However, it remains unclear via which underlying processes this practice can impact diagnostic performance. This study therefore examined the effect of a diagnostic suggestion in a GP’s referral letter to the emergency department on the diagnostic performance of medical interns. Methods: Medical interns diagnosed six clinical cases formatted as GP referral letters in a randomized within-subjects experiment. They diagnosed two referral letters stating a main complaint without a diagnostic suggestion (control), two stating a correct suggestion, and two stating an incorrect suggestion. The referral question and case order were randomized. We analysed the effect of the referral question on interns’ diagnostic accuracy, number of differential diagnoses, confidence, and time taken to diagnose. Results: Forty-four medical interns participated. Interns considered more diagnoses in their differential without a suggested diagnosis (M = 1.85, SD = 1.09) than with a suggested diagnosis, independent of whether this suggestion was correct (M = 1.52, SD = 0.96, d = 0.32) or incorrect ((M = 1.42, SD = 0.97, d = 0.41), _2(2) =7.6, p = 0.022). The diagnostic suggestion did not influence diagnostic accuracy (_2(2) = 1.446, p = 0.486), confidence, (_2(2) = 0.058, p = 0.971) or time to diagnose (_2(2) = 3.128, p = 0.209). Conclusions: A diagnostic suggestion in a GPs referral letter did not influence subsequent diagnostic accuracy, confidence, or time to diagnose for medical interns. However, a correct or incorrect suggestion reduced the number of diagnoses considered. It is important for healthcare providers and teachers to be aware of this phenomenon, as fostering a broad differential could support learning. Future research is necessary to examine whether these findings generalize to other healthcare workers, such as more experienced specialists or triage nurses, whose decisions might affect the diagnostic process later on.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven referring clinicians completed preevacuation proctography questionnaires for 50 patients, detailing diagnoses, confidence in these, intended management, and what they hoped to learn. After evacuation proctography, the radiology report was returned with a second questionnaire asking the diagnosis in the light of evacuation proctographic findings, their confidence, and what they had learned. Clinicians quantified management contribution and indicated how useful they found evacuation proctography in general. Results from pre- and post-evacuation proctography questionnaires were compared to determine the diagnostic and therapeutic effects. RESULTS: Diagnostic confidence rose significantly after evacuation proctography (mean, 7.0 before evacuation proctography vs 8.4 after evacuation proctography; P < .001). Lead diagnosis changed in nine (18%) patients. Intended surgical management became nonsurgical after evacuation proctography in seven (14%) patients, and intended nonsurgical therapy became surgical in two (4%). Surgery remained likely in 15 patients, but its nature changed in five (10%). Five (10%) clinicians stated that evacuation proctographic findings resolved diagnostic conflict, and nine (18%) found that evacuation proctographic findings revealed unsuspected diagnoses. Clinicians found evacuation proctography of major benefit in 20 (40%) cases studied and of moderate benefit in 20 (40%).

"Dreiseitl, S.; Binder, M.",Do physicians value decision support? A look at the effect of decision support systems on physician opinion,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,"Clinical decision support systems are on the verge of becoming routine software tools in clinical settings. We investigate the question of how physicians react when faced with decision support suggestions that contradict their own diagnoses. We used a study design involving 52 volunteer dermatologists who each rated the malignancy of 25 lesion images on an ordinal scale and gave a dichotomous excise/no excise recommendation for each lesion image. After seeing the system's rating and excise suggestions, the physicians could revise their initial recommendations. We observed that in 24% of the cases in which the physicians' diagnoses did not match those of the decision support system, the physicians changed their diagnoses. There was a slight but significant negative correlation between susceptibility to change and experience level of the physicians. Physicians were significantly less likely to follow the decision system's recommendations when they were confident of their initial diagnoses. No differences between the physicians' inclinations to following excise versus no excise recommendations could be observed. These results indicate that physicians are quite susceptible to accepting the recommendations of decision support systems, and that quality assurance and validation of such systems is therefore of paramount importance. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Objective We investigated whether diagnostic accuracy of chest pain cases is influenced by the order of presentation of the history and electrocardiogram (EKG) to cardiology residents. Methods We conducted an experimental study during a resident training in 2019. Twelve clinical cases were presented in 2 diagnostic rounds. Residents were randomly allocated to seeing the EKG first (EKGF) or the history first (HF). The mean diagnostic accuracy scores (range 0-1) and confidence level (0-100) in each diagnostic round and time needed to make the diagnosis were evaluated. Results The final diagnostic accuracy was higher than the initial in both groups. After the first round, diagnostic accuracy was higher in HF (n=24) than in EKGF (n=28). Time taken to judge the history was comparable in both groups. Time taken to judge the EKG was shorter in HF (40±11 vs 64±13 seconds; P<.01). Time invested in the second round was significantly correlated with changing the initial diagnosis. A significant difference was observed in confidence ratings after the initial diagnosis, with EKGF reporting less confidence relative to HF.

Over the past decade, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that extreme prevalence (both high and low) leads to an increase in errors. While this “prevalence effect” is well established, the cognitive and/or perceptual mechanisms responsible for it are not. One reason for this is that the most common tool for analyzing prevalence effects, Signal Detection Theory, cannot distinguish between different biases that might be present. Through an application to pathology image-based decisionmaking, we illustrate that an evidence accumulation modeling framework can be used to disentangle different types of biases. Importantly, our results show that prevalence influences both response expectancy and stimulus evaluation biases, with novices (students, N = 96) showing a more pronounced response expectancy bias and experts (medical laboratory professionals, N = 19) showing a more pronounced stimulus evaluation bias.",2021,No,Cell scans (cancer identification),,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Medical Students / Imaging,No,,Yes,58,,Confidence with Experience,,"Novices tended toward response expectancy bias in extreme prevalence, experts with stimulus expectency bias"
"Costa Filho, G. B.; Moura, A. S.; Brandão, P. R.; Schmidt, H. G.; Mamede, S.","Effects of deliberate reflection on diagnostic accuracy, confidence and diagnostic calibration in dermatology",Perspectives on Medical Education,"Background: Deliberate reflection on initial diagnoses improved diagnostic accuracy in internal medicine and general practice, but it is unknown if the same occurs in specialties that rely mostly on visual perception, such as dermatology. Moreover, whether reflection influences diagnostic calibration has not been studied yet. Diagnostic calibration, the relationship between diagnostic accuracy and confidence in that accuracy, affects diagnostic performance because overconfidence tends to induce premature closure. This study evaluated the effects of deliberate reflection on diagnostic accuracy and diagnostic calibration in dermatology. Methods: Sixty-one sixth-year students from a Brazilian medical school were allocated to either a reflection group (RG) or a control group (CG). In both groups, students worked with the same 12 dermatological images, presented sequentially, providing an initial diagnosis and confidence in that diagnosis. Subsequently, RG students reflected on the case using a structured procedure, while CG students performed a time-filler activity. All students then provided a final diagnosis and confidence in that diagnosis. Outcome measurements were diagnostic accuracy, confidence, and calibration. Results: Reflection increased diagnostic accuracy relative to control (49.7_± 12.1 vs 38.4_± 14.6; p_= 0.002) but did not affect confidence (64.3_± 13.2 vs 58.9_± 20.1; p_=_0.228) nor calibration (0.15_± 0.16 vs 0.20_± 0.19, p_=_0.197). Overall, case difficulty influenced calibration, with students showing more overconfidence on more difficult cases (p_<0.001).

"van Hout, H.P.J.; Vernooij-Dassen, M.J.; Stalman, W.A.B.",Diagnosing dementia with confidence by GPs,Family Practice,"Background. Earlier reports suggest limited clinical reasoning and substantial uncertainty of GPs in assessing patients suspected of dementia. Objective. To explore the predictors of GPs to decide on the presence and absence of dementia as well as the predictors of diagnostic confidence of GPs. Design. An observational study was set up among 107 patients of 64 GPs. The GPs were instructed to use the Dutch national dementia guideline on consecutive patients newly suspected of dementia and to register their assessment on a detailed form. The predictors of the presence and absence of dementia according to the GPs and their diagnostic confidence were explored by logistic regression analyses. Main outcome measures. Dependent variables: (i) presence and absence of dementia according to GPs and (ii) diagnostic confidence. Independent variables: clinical (cognitive, behavioural, somatic, functional), applications of recommendations, patient related and GP related. Results. Dementia was diagnosed in 67% of the suspected patients. The presence of dementia according to the GPs was positively associated with observed impairment of the higher cognitive functions, absence of depression and female gender of patients. The GPs expressed diagnostic confidence in 58% of the cases. This was positively associated with application of recommendations, ADL dependency, longer duration, informant availability, restless behaviour and a patient's female gender. Use of the Mini Mental Status Examination was not associated with confidence. Conclusions. GPs seem to base the diagnosis of dementia on rational grounds. Application of the dementia guideline's recommendations may contribute to more diagnostic confidence. © The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press.

While experiments have shown bias to cause errors, physicians of similar expertise differed in susceptibility to bias. Resisting bias is often said to depend on engaging analytical reasoning, disregarding the influence of knowledge. We examined the role of knowledge and reasoning mode, indicated by diagnosis time and confidence, as predictors of susceptibility to anchoring bias. Anchoring bias occurs when physicians stick to an incorrect diagnosis triggered by early salient distracting features (SDF) despite subsequent conflicting information. Methods: Sixty-eight internal medicine residents from two Dutch university hospitals participated in a two-phase experiment. Phase 1: assessment of knowledge of discriminating features (ie, clinical findings that discriminate between lookalike diseases) for six diseases. Phase 2 (1 week later): diagnosis of six cases of these diseases. Each case had two versions differing exclusively in the presence/absence of SDF. Each participant diagnosed three cases with SDF (SDF+) and three without (SDF-). Participants were randomly allocated to case versions. Based on phase 1 assessment, participants were split into higher knowledge or lower knowledge groups. Main outcome measurements: frequency of diagnoses associated with SDF; time to diagnose; and confidence in diagnosis. Results: While both knowledge groups performed similarly on SDF- cases, higher knowledge physicians succumbed to anchoring bias less frequently than their lower knowledge counterparts on SDF+ cases (p=0.02). Overall, physicians spent more time (p<0.001) and had lower confidence (p=0.02) on SDF+ than SDF- cases (p<0.001). However, when diagnosing SDF+ cases, the groups did not differ in time (p=0.88) nor in confidence (p=0.96). Conclusions: Physicians apparently adopted a more analytical reasoning approach when presented with distracting features, indicated by increased time and lower confidence, trying to combat bias. Yet, extended deliberation alone did not explain the observed performance differences between knowledge groups. Success in mitigating anchoring bias was primarily predicted by knowledge of discriminating features of diagnoses. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024. No commercial re-use.

The authors conducted the study using a computer-based system to view and diagnose virtual slide cases. The software recorded participant responses throughout the diagnostic process, and automatically classified participant actions based on definitions of eight common heuristics and/or biases. The authors measured frequency of heuristic use and bias across three levels of training. Biases studied were detected at varying frequencies, with availability and search satisficing observed most frequently. There were few significant differences by level of training. For representativeness and anchoring, the heuristic was used appropriately as often or more often than it was used in biased judgment. Approximately half of the diagnostic errors were associated with one or more biases. We conclude that heuristic use and biases were observed among physicians at all levels of training using the virtual slide system, although their frequencies varied. The system can be employed to detect heuristic use and to test methods for decreasing diagnostic errors resulting from cognitive biases. © 2012 The Author(s).",2013,No,Dermatoligical slides,Scale from -1 to +1,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes (levels of training),Yes,Yes (rated),Pathology / Dermatology,No,,Yes,71,,Confidence with Experience,,"Detection of heuristic and biases across experience levels, search satisfying"

Within the diagnostic process, accurately detecting a multimorbid disease pattern still poses a major challenge for most physicians, and is known as a source of diagnostic uncertainty. Objective We investigated, how sensitive, confident, and accurate physicians are in diagnosing multimorbid versus monomorbid patients. Methods We created eight video case-based vignettes, which differed in type of morbidity (multimorbid versus monomorbid), field of medical specialization (somatic versus mental), and relatedness of underlying diseases (causally related versus unrelated). In total, 74 physicians (GPs, residents in an emergency department and psychiatrists) watched three to five randomly allocated video cases and had to generate suspected diagnoses at the end of each of three video sequences. Additionally, participating physicians rated subjective confidence for all mentioned diagnoses and for three sequences per case with the help of confidence profiles. Results Altogether, physicians made a large number of accurate diagnoses (69%). Nevertheless, the overall number of underdiagnosed multimorbid cases (misses) was significantly higher (71%) than over-diagnosed monomorbid cases (false alarms) (7%). Discussion According to Signal Detection Theory, GPs and psychiatrists both showed lower detection performance for medical cases that lay beyond their own field of specialization. Remarkably, residents show the highest sensitivity for multimorbid cases with an approximately identically detection performance d’ slightly over 1 for both field of medical specialization (somatic and mental). Furthermore, higher uncertainty in diagnosing multimorbid cases is related to lower confidence especially at the beginning of a diagnostic process, as well as to unrelated and therefore probably rare disease pattern. Several limitations of the study and the video case-based vignettes are described within the discussion section. Conclusions Physicians have to be sensitized for multimorbidity even more, and have to be taught in the prevalence of existing disease combinations. Communicating uncertainty with other specialists could be helpful when faced with a sometimes “fuzzy” pattern of symptoms. © 2019 Hausmann et al.

Since most deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU) occur after withdrawal of life-support, medical decision-making is crucial for acute DoC patients. Neuroimaging informs decision-making, yet the precise effects of MRI on decision-making in the ICU are poorly understood. We investigated the impact of brain MRI on prognostication, therapeutic decisions and physician confidence in ICU patients with DoC. Methods: In this simulated decision-making study utilizing a prospective ICU cohort, a panel of neurocritical experts first reviewed clinical information (without MRI) from 75 acute DoC patients and made decisions about diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Following review of the MRI, the panel then decided if the initial decisions needed revision. In parallel, a blinded neuroradiologist reassessed all neuroimaging. Results: MRI led to changes in clinical management of 57 (76%) of patients (Number-Needed-to-Test for any change: 1.32), including revised diagnoses (20%), levels of care (21%), diagnostic confidence (43%) and prognostications (33%). Decisions were revised more often with stroke than with other brain injuries (p = 0.02). However, although MRI revealed additional pathology in 81%, this did not predict revised clinical decision-making (p-values ≥0.08). Conclusion: MRI results changed decision-making in 3 of 4 ICU patients, but radiological findings were not predictive of clinical decision-making. This highlights the need to better understand the effects of neuroimaging on management decisions.

"van Sassen, C.; Mamede, S.; Bos, M.; van den Broek, W.; Bindels, P.; Zwaan, L.",Do malpractice claim clinical case vignettes enhance diagnostic accuracy and acceptance in clinical reasoning education during GP training?,BMC Medical Education,"Background: Using malpractice claims cases as vignettes is a promising approach for improving clinical reasoning education (CRE), as malpractice claims can provide a variety of content- and context-rich examples. However, the effect on learning of adding information about a malpractice claim, which may evoke a deeper emotional response, is not yet clear. This study examined whether knowing that a diagnostic error resulted in a malpractice claim affects diagnostic accuracy and self-reported confidence in the diagnosis of future cases. Moreover, suitability of using erroneous cases with and without a malpractice claim for CRE, as judged by participants, was evaluated. Methods: In the first session of this two-phased, within-subjects experiment, 81 first-year residents of general practice (GP) were exposed to both erroneous cases with (M) and erroneous cases without (NM) malpractice claim information, derived from a malpractice claims database. Participants rated suitability of the cases for CRE on a five-point Likert scale. In the second session, one week later, participants solved four different cases with the same diagnoses. Diagnostic accuracy was measured with three questions, scored on a 0–1 scale: (1) What is your next step? (2) What is your differential diagnosis? (3) What is your most probable diagnosis and what is your level of certainty on this? Both subjective suitability and diagnostic accuracy scores were compared between the versions (M and NM) using repeated measures ANOVA. Results: There were no differences in diagnostic accuracy parameters (M vs. NM next step: 0.79 vs. 0.77, p = 0.505; differential diagnosis 0.68 vs. 0.75, p = 0.072; most probable diagnosis 0.52 vs. 0.57, p = 0.216) and self-reported confidence (53.7% vs. 55.8% p = 0.390) of diagnoses previously seen with or without malpractice claim information. Subjective suitability- and complexity scores for the two versions were similar (suitability: 3.68 vs. 3.84, p = 0.568; complexity 3.71 vs. 3.88, p = 0.218) and significantly increased for higher education levels for both versions. Conclusion: The similar diagnostic accuracy rates between cases studied with or without malpractice claim information suggests both versions are equally effective for CRE in GP training. Residents judged both case versions to be similarly suitable for CRE; both were considered more suitable for advanced than for novice learners. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,Yes,Cases with and without malpractice claim information,0-100 confidence,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes (probable and differential diagnosis),No,General Practice,No,,No,81,,Differential Information Intervention,,No difference in accuracy or confidence with or without malpractice claims.

Most occur post discharge, and can result in potentially preventable readmission or unnecessary urgent evaluation. Mobile health approaches incorporating patient-generated wound photos are being implemented in an attempt to optimize triage and management. We assessed how adding wound photos to existing data sources modifies provider decision making. Study Design: We used a web-based simulation survey using a convenience sample of providers with expertise in surgical infections. Participants viewed a range of scenarios, including surgical history, physical exam, and description of wound appearance. All participants reported SSI diagnosis, diagnostic confidence, and management recommendations (main outcomes) first without, and then with, accompanying wound photos. At each step, participants ranked the most important features contributing to their decision. Results: Eighty-three participants completed a median of 5 scenarios (interquartile range 4 to 7).

The addition of photos improved overall diagnostic accuracy from 67% to 76% (p<0.001), and increased specificity from 77% to 92% (p<0.001), but did not significantly increase sensitivity (55% to 65%; p=0.16). Photos increased mean confidence in diagnosis from 5.9 of 10 to 7.4 of 10 (p<0.001). Overtreatment recommendations decreased from 48% to 16% (p<0.001), and undertreatment did not change (28% to 23%; p=0.20) with the addition of photos.

D.; Ring, D.",Surgeon confidence in an outpatient setting,Hand,"Background: We have the impression that provider uncertainty arises from either nonspecific pathology or disproportionate symptoms and disability, both of which correlate with symptoms of depression, heightened illness concern, and low patient self-efficacy. This study tested the primary null hypothesis that there is no correlation between provider confidence and patient self-efficacy. Methods: Eighty-five patients visiting an orthopedic hand and upper extremity surgeon completed the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ). The surgeon's confidence in the diagnosis, optimal treatment, expected outcome, and the anticipated satisfaction of the patient and the referring doctor were measured with five questions rated on 5-point Likert scales (Physician Confidence Scale). Results: Overall physician confidence was high and there was no correlation between the PSEQ score and the Physician Confidence Scale. Provider confidence was significantly lower for nonspecific diagnoses, but there was no significant difference between the mean PSEQ for the 72 patients with a specific diagnosis and the 12 patients with nonspecific diagnoses.

Inaccurate calibration can lead to maltreatment and increased health care costs. This study was conducted to investigate whether calibration accuracy can be improved among both board certified medical specialists and medical students by providing them with a simple form of feedback (i.e., performance standards). We expected that performance standards would enhance calibration accuracy. Furthermore, we expected that medical specialists would overall be better calibrated than medical students. Methods: Medical specialists (n=42) and medical students (n=43) diagnosed three clinical cases and rated their own performance, after which they did or did not receive standards (i.e., the correct diagnoses). All participants were then tested: they had to diagnose three new cases and had to rate their performance without receiving diagnostic feedback Results: In support of our hypotheses, findings indicate that both students and specialists who received performance standards calibrated better than students and specialists who did not receive standards. Furthermore, medical specialists calibrated better than medical students.

In a mixed-method design, a metacognitive calibration selfassessing (MCC) survey tool was applied to HFPS (n = 80, 20 teams of 6 medical students) and semistructured interviews were conducted with faculty (n = 5). When scored by faculty with a rubric, the mean student accuracy ranged from 23% to 74%, whereas their self-assessment of conﬁdence ranged from 71% to 86%. This result revealed overconﬁdence bias in novice students regarding the correctness of their wrong responses. The most common misconception identiﬁed was inverting cause and effect: metabolic acidosis was pointed to as the cause of the patient’s problems rather than a consequence of untreated diabetes mellitus. The most common treatment error was overtreatment, with unnecessary added medication. Interviews with faculty suggested that the MCC tool improved the team process by slowing students down, requiring them to think through their answers, and that overall the tool improved their critical thinking.

In particular, we examined what forms of cognitive engagement students used while diagnosing virtual patients and whether engagement forms predicted students’ diagnostic confidence and efficacy. A total of 88 medical students from a large North American university voluntarily participated in this study. We used latent profile analysis (LPA), a person-centered statistical method, to identify groups of students with similar information processing patterns. Findings from this study revealed that students displayed various forms of cognitive engagement, i.e. recipience, resource management, and task-focused. Moreover, we found that group difference in diagnostic confidence was moderated by task complexity. In terms of diagnostic efficacy, students who were task-focused or resource managers did better than the recipience students.

Objectives: To test the effect of improved realism of clinical judgement tasks on confidence calibration performance of nurses and student nurses. Design: A comparative confidence calibration analysis. Settings: The study was conducted in a large university of Northern England. Methods: Ninety-seven participants rated their confidence - using a scale that ranged from 0 (no confidence) to 100 (totally confident) on dichotomous clinical judgements of critical event risk. The judgements were in response to 25 paper-based and 25 higher fidelity scenarios using a computerised patient simulator and clinical equipment. Scenarios, and judgement criteria of 'correctness', were generated from real patient cases. Using a series of calibration measures (calibration, resolution and over/underconfidence), participants' confidence was calibrated against the proportion of correct judgements. The calibration measures generated by the paper-based and high fidelity clinical simulation conditions were compared. Results: Participants made significantly less accurate clinical judgements of risk in the high fidelity clinical simulations compared to the paper simulations (P=0.0002). They were significantly less confident in high fidelity clinical simulations than paper simulations (P=0.03). However, there was no significant difference of over/underconfidence for participants between the two simulated settings (P=0.06). Participants were no better calibrated in the high fidelity clinical simulations than paper simulations, P=0.85. Likewise, participants had no better ability of discriminating correct judgements from incorrect judgements as measured by the resolution statistic in high fidelity clinical simulations than paper simulations, P=0.76. Conclusions: Improving the realism of simulated judgement tasks led to reduced confidence and judgement accuracy in participants but did not alter confidence calibration. These findings suggest that judgemental miscalibration of confidence in nurses may be a systematic cognitive bias and that simply making scenarios more realistic may not be a sufficient condition for correction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,Yes,Both paper and high fidelity sim scenarios,0-100 confidence,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes (nurses and student nurses),No,No,Nursing,No,,Yes,97,,Calibration,,"Less accurate and less confident in high-fidelity than on paper, not better calibrated"

A previous study showed that physicians’ diagnostic calibration for easy cases improved, after they received feedback on their previous diagnoses. We investigated whether diagnostic calibration would also improve from this feedback when cases were more difficult. Sixty-nine general-practice residents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the feedback condition, they diagnosed a case, rated their confidence in their diagnosis, their invested mental effort, and case complexity, and then were shown the correct diagnosis (feedback). This was repeated for 12 cases. Participants in the control condition did the same without receiving feedback. We analysed calibration in terms of (1) absolute accuracy (absolute difference between diagnostic accuracy and confidence), and (2) bias (confidence minus diagnostic calibration). There was no difference between the conditions in the measurements of calibration (absolute accuracy, p =.204; bias, p =.176). Post-hoc analyses showed that on correctly diagnosed cases (on which participants are either accurate or underconfident), calibration in the feedback condition was less accurate than in the control condition, p =.013. This study shows that feedback on diagnostic performance did not improve physicians’ calibration for more difficult cases. One explanation could be that participants were confronted with their mistakes and thereafter lowered their confidence ratings even if cases were diagnosed correctly.

Using higher fidelity clinical simulations to elicit clinicians’ confidence 'calibration' (i.e. overconfidence or underconfidence) in more realistic settings is a promising but underutilized tactic. In this study we examine nurses’ calibration of confidence with judgment accuracy for critical event risk assessment judgments in a high fidelity simulated clinical environment. The study also explores the effects of clinical experience, task difficulty and time pressure on the relationship between confidence and accuracy.     Methods: 63 student and 34 experienced nurses made dichotomous risk assessments on 25 scenarios simulated in a high fidelity clinical environment. Each nurse also assigned a score (0–100) reflecting the level of confidence in their judgments. Scenarios were derived from real patient cases and classified as easy or difficult judgment tasks. Nurses made half of their judgments under time pressure. Confidence calibration statistics were calculated and calibration curves generated.     Results: Nurse students were underconfident (mean over/underconfidence score _1.05) and experienced nurses overconfident (mean over/underconfidence score 6.56), P = 0.01. No significant differences in calibration and resolution were found between the two groups (P = 0.80 and P = 0.51, respectively). There was a significant interaction between time pressure and task difficulty on confidence (P = 0.008); time pressure increased confidence in easy cases but reduced confidence in difficult cases. Time pressure had no effect on confidence or accuracy. Judgment task difficulty impacted significantly on nurses’ judgmental accuracy and confidence. A 'hard-easy' effect was observed: nurses were overconfident in difficult judgments and underconfident in easy judgments.     Conclusion: Nurses were poorly calibrated when making risk assessment judgments in a high fidelity simulated setting. Nurses with more experience tended toward overconfidence. Whilst time pressure had little effect on calibration, nurses’ over/underconfidence varied significantly with the degree of task difficulty.

We investigated whether general practice residents would learn the deliberate reflection procedure through ‘learning-by-teaching’ and apply it to diagnose new cases. The study was a two-phase experiment. In the learning phase, 56 general-practice residents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. They either (1) studied examples of deliberate reflection and then explained the procedure to a fictitious peer on video; or (2) solved cases without reflection (control).

In contrast to findings on learning-by-teaching from other domains, teaching deliberate reflection to a fictitious peer, did not increase reflective reasoning when diagnosing future cases.

Edward; Keenan, Greg; Delaney, Brendan C.; Douiri, Abdel",Information Distortion in Physicians’ Diagnostic Judgments,Medical Decision Making,"Background: Information distortion suggests that people change the evaluation of new information to support an emerging belief. The present study was designed to measure the extent to which physicians distort incoming medical information to support an emerging diagnosis. Design: Data were collected via an anonymous questionnaire. The experimental group (102 physicians) read 3 patient scenarios, each with 2 competing diagnoses. Physicians first read information that favored 1 of the 2 diagnoses (the “steer”). They then rated a series of neutral cues that favored neither diagnosis. At each cue presentation, respondents rated the extent to which cues favored either diagnosis and updated the strength of their diagnostic belief. After the neutral cues in the third scenario, respondents rated cues that opposed the initial steer. A control group (36 physicians) rated all the cues in random order and not within scenarios, thus providing unbiased baseline ratings for calculating distortion in the experimental group. Results: Distortion was statistically significant ( P < 0.001) and was associated with the strength of belief in the leading diagnosis. Physicians with over 10 years in practice distorted less than their less experienced counterparts ([Formula: see text] = 1.04 v. [Formula: see text] = 1.78, P < 0.05). Having developed an initial diagnostic leaning consistent with the steer, 56% of physicians remained committed to it after receiving the conflicting cues. Distortion was strongly associated with commitment to the steer (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.79; P = 0.03). Limitations: Physicians did not elicit information; therefore, the authors cannot estimate the size of distortion in tasks involving information search.

Methods: A national sample (N = 108) of 67 internists, 35 family physicians, and 6 other U.S. physicians used QMR to assist in the diagnosis of written clinical cases. Three sets of eight cases stratified by diagnostic difficulty and the potential of QMR to produce high-quality information were used. A 2 x 2 repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test whether these factors were associated with perceived usefulness of QMR and physicians' diagnostic confidence after using QMR. Correlations were computed among physician characteristics, ratings of QMR usefulness, and physicians' confidence in their own diagnoses, and between usefulness or confidence and actual diagnostic performance. Results: The analyses showed that QMR was perceived to be significantly more useful (P < 0.05) on difficult cases, on cases where QMR could provide high-quality information, by non-board-certified physicians, and when diagnostic confidence was lower. Diagnostic confidence was higher when comfort with using certain QMR functions was higher. The ratings of usefulness or diagnostic confidence were not consistently correlated with diagnostic performance. Conclusions: The results suggest that users' diagnostic confidence and perceptions of QMR usefulness may be associated more with their need for decision support than with their actual diagnostic performance when using the system.

Participants: One-hundred and nine pediatric residents from all levels of training. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to the I-RED vs. control group, and within each group, they were further randomized to the order in which they saw simple and complex cases. The I-RED strategy involved an instruction to look for a constellation of symptoms, signs, clinical data or circumstances that should heighten suspicion for a serious condition. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy, scored as 1 if any of the three differentials given by participants included the correct diagnosis, and 0 if not.

Various studies have shown this form of self_regulation to be more trustworthy than aggregate judgements (i.e. self_assessments) of one's capacity in a given domain. However, little is known regarding what cues inform learners’ self_monitoring, which limits an informed exploration of interventions that might facilitate improvements in self_monitoring capacity. The purpose of this study is to understand the influence of characteristics of the individual (e.g. ability) and characteristics of the problem (e.g. case difficulty) on the accuracy of self_monitoring by medical students.

Suggested solutions include slowing down the reasoning process. However, slower reasoning is not necessarily more accurate than faster reasoning. In this study, we studied the relationship between time to diagnose and diagnostic accuracy. Methods: We conducted a multi-center within-subjects experiment where we prospectively induced availability bias (using Mamede et al.’s methodology) in 117 internal medicine residents. Subsequently, residents diagnosed cases that resembled those bias cases but had another correct diagnosis. We determined whether residents were correct, incorrect due to bias (i.e. they provided the diagnosis induced by availability bias) or due to other causes (i.e. they provided another incorrect diagnosis) and compared time to diagnose. Results: We did not successfully induce bias: no significant effect of availability bias was found. Therefore, we compared correct diagnoses to all incorrect diagnoses. Residents reached correct diagnoses faster than incorrect diagnoses (115 s vs. 129 s, p <.001). Exploratory analyses of cases where bias was induced showed a trend of time to diagnose for bias diagnoses to be more similar to correct diagnoses (115 s vs 115 s, p =.971) than to other errors (115 s vs 136 s, p =.082). Conclusions: We showed that correct diagnoses were made faster than incorrect diagnoses, even within subjects. Errors due to availability bias may be different: exploratory analyses suggest a trend that biased cases were diagnosed faster than incorrect diagnoses. The hypothesis that fast reasoning leads to diagnostic errors should be revisited, but more research into the characteristics of cognitive biases is important because they may be different from other causes of diagnostic errors. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,Yes,8 clinical case,0-100% scale confidence that diagnosis was correct,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,Internal Medicine,No,,No,117,,Calibration,,"Correct cases took more similar durations to diagnose than errors (and faster), calibration not very high, no evidence of availability bias in confidence"

E.; Benenson, S.",Antimicrobial use in the ICU: Indications and accuracy - an observational trial.,Journal of Hospital Medicine,"BACKGROUND: In intensive care unit (ICU) patients, signs of infection and inflammation are similar, making diagnosis of bacterial infections difficult. Antimicrobials may therefore be overused, contributing to development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. OBJECTIVES: To measure the accuracy of clinician decisions to start antimicrobials; to correlate clinician certainty with the presence of infection; and to examine whether physiological variables correlate with clinician certainty. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Patients staying >48 hours in a general ICU of a tertiary care hospital. MEASUREMENTS: The ICU clinician's certainty for the presence of infection was recorded when starting antimicrobials. An independent infectious diseases (ID) specialist determined if antimicrobials were required and if infection was present. Clinician antibiotic start decisions were tested for accuracy according to the ID determination for the presence of infection. RESULTS: Empirical antimicrobial therapy was justified by the presence of infection on 67/125 (54%) occasions. Clinician certainty for infection correlated well with the presence of defined infection (r2=0.78), however, infection was defined on 6/19 (31%) occasions when ICU clinician certainty was low (2), and antimicrobials were prescribed even when clinician certainty was minimal. Antimicrobial course length was similar whether infection was defined or not (11.5+or-9.2 vs 10.7+or-9.1 days; P=0.65). Physiological variables were not associated with clinician certainty of infection.

W.; Zwaan, L.",Impact of performance and information feedback on medical interns' confidence–accuracy calibration,Advances in Health Sciences Education,"Diagnostic errors are a major, largely preventable, patient safety concern. Error interventions cannot feasibly be implemented for every patient that is seen. To identify cases at high risk of error, clinicians should have a good calibration between their perceived and actual accuracy. This experiment studied the impact of feedback on medical interns’ calibration and diagnostic process. In a two-phase experiment, 125 medical interns from Dutch University Medical Centers were randomized to receive no feedback (control), feedback on their accuracy (performance feedback), or feedback with additional information on why a certain diagnosis was correct (information feedback) on 20 chest X-rays they diagnosed in a feedback phase. A test phase immediately followed this phase and had all interns diagnose an additional 10 X-rays without feedback. Outcome measures were confidence–accuracy calibration, diagnostic accuracy, confidence, and time to diagnose. Both feedback types improved overall confidence–accuracy calibration (R2No Feedback = 0.05, R2Performance Feedback = 0.12, R2Information Feedback = 0.19), in line with the individual improvements in diagnostic accuracy and confidence. We also report secondary analyses to examine how case difficulty affected calibration. Time to diagnose did not differ between conditions. Feedback improved interns’ calibration. However, it is unclear whether this improvement reflects better confidence estimates or an improvement in accuracy. Future research should examine more experienced participants and non-visual specialties. Our results suggest that feedback is an effective intervention that could be beneficial as a tool to improve calibration, especially in cases that are not too difficult for learners. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,No,X-ray interpretation,0-10 confidence in diagnosis,No (manipulated to receive additional information),No,No,No,No,No,No,Medical Students,No,,No,125,,Calibration,,"Receiving feedback either on accuracy or on why a diagnosis was correct improved test accuracy and calibration later, the latter slightly more"

Since early HF symptoms are ambiguous, doctors may overlook HF as possible cause and misinterpret the signs. The aim was to analyse differences in general practitioners' (GPs) HF diagnosis and diagnostic certainty by patient age and gender and to identify reasons for possible differences. Design Factorial design with video vignettes presenting patients (played by professional actors) with early HF symptoms was used. Video vignettes differed regarding patients' gender (male/female), age (55 years/75 years) and migration background (no/yes: Turkish), while the dialogue was identical. GPs were asked about possible diagnoses and certainty of diagnoses (quantitative) and to narrate their thoughts on considered diagnoses (qualitative). Setting General practices in northern Germany. Participants 128 GPs stratified by gender and length of clinical experience (≤15 years or >15 years). Results GPs considered HF more often in women than men (predicted probabilities with 95% CI: 0.83 (0.68 to 0.92) vs 0.63 (0.44 to 0.79), p=0.02), especially in older women compared with younger men (predicted probabilities with 95% CI: 0.89 (0.68 to 0.96) vs 0.52 (0.31 to 0.72), p=0,03). Suspected HF was not reasoned by the patient's gender and only seldom by the patient's age, but by reported symptoms. Diagnostic certainty of HF was higher in women than in men (predicted proportions with 95% CI: 0.48 (0.39 to 0.58) vs 0.36 (0.27 to 0.45), p=0.01), with highest certainty in older women and lowest in younger men (0.57 (0.45 to 0.69) vs 0.27 (0.17 to 0.37), p<0.01). GPs explained their certainty referring to both typical HF symptoms and their gut feeling. Conclusion Despite an identical dialogue, the study showed differences by patients' gender and age in frequency and certainty of HF diagnosis. In order to avoid that GPs overlook or misinterpret early signs of HF, it is important to critically reflect diagnostic decisions and possible social influences. ©",2022,Yes,Video vignettes,0-100% certainty,Yes,No,No,No,Yes (stratified by clinical experience),No,No,General Practice,Yes (age),,Yes,128,Mixture,Downstream Confidence / Patient Factors,,"Heart failure susepcted with higher certainty in women compared to men despite identical patient dialogue, especially older women"

Methods. An experiment was conducted in which 16 (= 24) videotapes portraying patient-physician encounters for two medical conditions (polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and depression) were randomly assigned to physicians for viewing. Each video presented a combination of four patient attributes (65 years or 80 years of age; male or female; black or white; blue or white collar occupation). Steps were taken to enhance external validity. One hundred twenty-eight eligible physicians were sampled from the northeastern United States, with numbers balanced across 16 (= 24) strata generated from the following characteristics (male or female; < 15 or ≥ 15 years since graduation; black or white; internists or family practitioners). The outcomes studied were: 1) the most likely diagnosis; 2) level of certainty adhering to that diagnosis; and 3) the number of tests that would be ordered. Results. Patient attributes (namely age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status) had no influence on the three outcomes studied (the most likely diagnosis, the level of certainty, and test ordering behavior). This was consistent across the two medical conditions portrayed (PMR and depression). In contrast, characteristics of physicians (namely their medical specialty, race, and age) interactively influenced medical decision-making. Conclusion. Epidemiologically important patient attributes (which Bayesian decision theorists hold should be influential) had no effect on medical decision-making for the two conditions, while clinically extraneous physician characteristics (which should not be influential) had a statistically significant effect.

"Yang, Huiqin; Thompson, Carl",Nurses’ risk assessment judgements: a confidence calibration study: Nurses’ risk assessment judgements,Journal of Advanced Nursing,"Background. Miscalibration (i.e. under-conﬁdence or over-conﬁdence of conﬁdence levels) has an important impact on the quality of nursing care. Despite this, little is known about how nurses’ subjective conﬁdence is calibrated with the accuracy of their judgments.     Methods. A sample of 103 nursing students and 34 experienced nurses were exposed to 25 risk assessment vignettes. For each vignette they made dichotomous judgements of whether the patient in each scenario was at risk of a critical event, and assigned conﬁdence ratings (0–100) to their judgement calls. The clinical vignettes and judgement criteria were generated from real patient cases. The methodology of conﬁdence calibration was used to calculate calibration measures and generate calibration curves. Data were collected between March 2007 and January 2008. Findings. Experienced nurses were statistically signiﬁcantly more conﬁdent than students but no more accurate. Whilst students tended towards under-conﬁdence, experienced nurses were over-conﬁdent. Experienced nurses were no more calibrated than students. Experienced nurses were no better at discriminating between correct and incorrect judgements than students. These patterns were exacerbated when nurses and students were extremely over-conﬁdent or extremely under-conﬁdent.     Conclusion.

"Keene, T.; Pammer, K.; Lord, B.; Shipp, C.",Dispatch information affects diagnosis in paramedics: an experimental study of applied dual-process theory,International Journal of Emergency Services,"Purpose: Previous research has shown that paramedics form intuitive impressions based on limited “pre-arrival” dispatch information and this subsequently affects their diagnosis. However, this observation has never been experimentally studied. Design/methodology/approach: This was an experimental study of 83 Australian undergraduate paramedics and 65 Australian paramedics with median 14 years' experience (Range: 1–32 years). Participants responded to written vignettes in two parts that aimed to induce an intuitive impression by placing participants under time pressure and with a secondary task, followed by a diagnosis made without distraction or time pressure. The vignettes varied the likelihood of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and measured self-reports of typicality and confidence. Answer fluency, which is the ease with which the answer comes to mind, was also measured. Findings: More participants exposed to the likely pre-arrival vignette recorded a final diagnosis of ACS, than those exposed to unlikely pre-arrival information (0.85 [95%CI: 0.78, 0.90] vs 0.74 [95%CI: 0.66, 0.81]; p = 0.03).

Answer fluency and confidence were associated with the impression, while the impression and confidence were associated with final diagnosis.

Decision making is an important daily nursing activity. Given contradictory past findings concerning the ease of use of cognitive schema for reaching decisions among experts and novices, we chose to examine consistency of information as a parameter that may clarify the process of decision making. Ninety-two experienced nurses and 65 nursing students rated their decisional difficulty and levels of certainty in reaching a diagnosis for two scenarios: one including consistent information and one providing information that was partly inconsistent with the given diagnosis. For the consistent information, students showed more difficulty and less certainty in the given diagnosis than the experienced nurses. The inconsistent scenario was perceived as more difficult by nurses in comparison to students.

This study explored the metacognitive judgments of 157 first-year medical students; in particular, the study examined students’ self-assessments or calibration as they engaged in a virtual-patient simulation targeting clinical reasoning practices. Examining two key subtasks of a patient encounter, history (Hx) and physical exam (PE), the authors assessed the level of variation in students’ behavioral performance (i.e., effectiveness and efficiency) and judgments of performance (i.e., calibration bias and accuracy) across the two subtasks. Paired t tests revealed that the Hx subtask was deemed to be more challenging than the PE subtask when viewed in terms of both actual and perceived performance. In addition to students performing worse on the Hx subtask than PE, they also perceived that they performed less well for Hx. Interestingly, across both subtasks, the majority of participants overestimated their performance (98% of participants for Hx and 95% for PE). Correlation analyses revealed that the participants’ overall level of accuracy in metacognitive judgments was moderately stable across the Hx and PE subtasks.

"Neugebauer, M.; Ebert, M.; Vogelmann, R.",A clinical decision support system improves antibiotic therapy for upper urinary tract infection in a randomized single-blinded study.,BMC Health Services Research,"Background: Due to increasing bacterial resistance rates choosing a correct empiric antibiotic therapy is getting more and more complex. Often medical doctors use information tools to make the right treatment choice. Methods: One hundred sixty six participants (77 medical doctors and 89 medical students) were asked to provide a diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in a simple fictive paper case of upper urinary tract infection (UTI) in a randomized single-blinded study. Participants were randomized to one of four information tools they were allowed to use in the study or control: 1. free internet access, 2. pharmaceutical pocket guide, 3. pocket guide antibiotic therapy, 4. clinical decision support system (CDSS), and control (no information tool). The CDSS was designed for the study. The adherence to the national German UTI guideline was evaluated. Results: Only 27.1% (n = 45/166) provided a correct diagnosis of upper UTI and 19.4% (n = 32/166) an antibiotic treatment recommended by national German treatment guidelines indicating their need for information tools. This result was not significantly different between medical doctors and medical students, residents and medical specialists or level of working experience. Using CDSS improved results significantly compared to conventional tools (diagnosis 57.1%; treatment recommendation 40.5%; p < 0,01). Processing time was not different between the use of CDSS and conventional information tools. CDSS users based their decision making on their assigned information tool more than users of conventional tools (73.8% vs. 48.0%; p < 0.01). Using CDSS improved the confidence of participants in their recommendation significantly compared to conventional tools (p < 0.01).

"Lambe, K.A.; Hevey, D.; Kelly, B.D.",Guided reflection interventions show no effect on diagnostic accuracy in medical students,Frontiers in Psychology,"Background: Guided reflection interventions, in an effort to reduce diagnostic error, encourage diagnosticians to generate alternative diagnostic hypotheses and gather confirming and disconfirming evidence before making a final diagnosis. This method has been found to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy in recent studies; however, it requires a significant investment of time, and psychological theory suggests the possibility for unintended consequences owing to cognitive bias. This study compared a short and long version of a guided reflection task on improvements in diagnostic accuracy, change in diagnostic confidence, and rates of corrected diagnoses. Methods: One hundred and eighty-six fourth- and fifth-year medical students diagnosed a series of fictional clinical cases, by first impressions (control condition) or by using a short or long guided reflection process, and rated their confidence in their initial diagnostic hypothesis at intervals throughout the process. In the ""short"" condition, participants were asked to generate two alternatives to their initial diagnostic hypothesis; in the ""long"" condition, six alternatives were required. Results: The reflective intervention did not elicit more accurate final diagnoses than diagnosis based on first impressions only. Participants who completed a short version of the task performed similarly to those who completed a long version. Neither the short nor long form elicited significant changes in diagnostic confidence from the beginning to the end of the diagnostic process, nor did the conditions differ on the rate of corrected diagnoses. Conclusions: This study finds no evidence to support the use of the guided reflection method as a diagnostic aid for novice diagnosticians, who may already use an analytical approach to diagnosis and therefore derive less benefit from this intervention than their more experienced colleagues.

"Kourtidis, Ploutarchos; Nurek, Martine; Delaney, Brendan; Kostopoulou, Olga",Influences of early diagnostic suggestions on clinical reasoning,Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications,"Previous research has highlighted the importance of physicians’ early hypotheses for their subsequent diagnostic decisions. It has also been shown that diagnostic accuracy improves when physicians are presented with a list of diagnostic suggestions to consider at the start of the clinical encounter. The psychological mechanisms underlying this improvement in accuracy are hypothesised. It is possible that the provision of diagnostic suggestions disrupts physicians’ intuitive thinking and reduces their certainty in their initial diagnostic hypotheses. This may encourage them to seek more information before reaching a diagnostic conclusion, evaluate this information more objectively, and be more open to changing their initial hypotheses. Three online experiments explored the effects of early diagnostic suggestions, provided by a hypothetical decision aid, on different aspects of the diagnostic reasoning process. Family physicians assessed up to two patient scenarios with and without suggestions. We measured effects on certainty about the initial diagnosis, information search and evaluation, and frequency of diagnostic changes. We did not find a clear and consistent effect of suggestions and detected mainly non-significant trends, some in the expected direction. We also detected a potential biasing effect: when the most likely diagnosis was included in the list of suggestions (vs. not included), physicians who gave that diagnosis initially, tended to request less information, evaluate it as more supportive of their diagnosis, become more certain about it, and change it less frequently when encountering new but ambiguous information; in other words, they seemed to validate rather than question their initial hypothesis. We conclude that further research using different methodologies and more realistic experimental situations is required to uncover both the beneficial and biasing effects of early diagnostic suggestions.",2022,Yes,2 patient scenarios with or without diagnostic suggestions,10 point visual analogue scale of certainty,Yes (but diagnostic aid used),No,Yes (what tests you would order),No,No,Yes,No,Family Medicine,No,,No,194,,Differential Information Intervention,Differential diagnosis list vs suggested diagnosis,"Diagnostic suggestion increased confidence, lower information seeking and led to less change in diagnoses"
"Friedman, C.; Gatti, G.; Elstein, A.; Franz, T.; Murphy, G.; Wolf, F.",Are clinicians correct when they believe they are correct? Implications for medical decision support,MEDINFO,"The process of clinical decision support is linked to the validity of clinicians' confidence in their judgments. Clinicians who are appropriately confident - highly confident when they are correct and less confident when they are incorrect - will access computer-based and other information resources only when they are needed. Clinicians who are consistently underconfident will rely on external resources when they are not needed. Those who are overconfident, who believe they are correct when in fact they are not, will be prone to medical errors. An extensive literature indicates a general tendency toward overconfidence in human judgment. This study explores the relationship between confidence and 'correctness', across three levels of clinical experience, in the task domain of diagnosis in internal medicine. We created detailed synopses of 36 diagnostically challenging cases and divided them into four equivalent sets of nine cases each. We asked 216 subjects at three experience levels (72 senior medical students, 72 senior medical residents, and 72 faculty attendings) to generate a differential diagnosis for each of the nine cases in one randomly-assigned set, and simultaneously to indicate their level of confidence in each of their diagnoses. We then examined the relationship between the correctness of these diagnoses (the appearance of the correct diagnosis anywhere in the hypothesis list) and these confidence judgments, for all subjects and separately for subjects at each experience level. Results indicate a small but statistically significant relationship associating correctness with higher confidence for all subjects (Kendall 's _b = -.106; p <.0001). This statistical relationship is strongest for the students (_b = -.121;p <.001), somewhat lesser but still significant for the faculty-level attendings (_b = -.103; p <.005), and non-significant (_b =-.041) for the residents. (The negative correlations are a coding artifact.) Subjects in this study showed a tendency toward underconfidence: they had low confidence in correct diagnoses more often than they had high confidence when wrong. Nonetheless, they were overconfident and thus 'error prone' for 17% of cases overall. The medical students were possibly overmatched by the difficulty of the cases, so their concordance between confidence and correctness may have resulted from an awareness that they were often guessing. The relatively low concordance seen in the residents and attendings makes a strong argument that decision support systems to reduce medical errors should include both 'push' and 'pull' models. In sum, these results indicate that medical decision support systems cannot rely exclusively on clinicians' perceptions of their information needs, as such perceptions will frequently be incorrect. © 2001 IMIA.

Interrater agreement and the agreement between pathologists' ratings and the majority MOLEM diagnosis were calculated by Gwet AC1 with quadratic weighting applied. The diagnostic confidence of pathologists was then assessed. Results: A total of 197 patients were included in the study (102 [51.8%] male; 95 [48.2%] female); mean (SD) age was 64.2 (15.8) years (range, 24-93 years). Overall, 217 index lesions were assessed with a total of 1516 histological diagnoses. Of 1516 diagnoses, 677 (44.7%) were classified as MOLEM class I; 120 (7.9%) as MOLEM class II; 564 (37.2%) as MOLEM class III; 114 (7.5%) as MOLEM class IV; and 55 (3.6%) as MOLEM class V. Concordance rates per MOLEM class were 88.6% (class I), 50.8% (class II), 76.2% (class III), 77.2% (class IV), and 74.2% (class V). The quadratic weighted interrater agreement was 91.3%, with a Gwet AC1 coefficient of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72-0.81). The quadratic weighted agreement between pathologists' ratings and majority MOLEM was 94.7%, with a Gwet AC1 coefficient of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84-0.88). The confidence in diagnosis data showed a relatively high level of confidence (between 1.0 and 1.5) when diagnosing classes I (mean [SD], 1.3 [0.3]), IV (1.3 [0.3]) and V (1.1 [0.1]); while classes II (1.8 [0.2]) and III (1.5 [0.4]) were diagnosed with a lower level of pathologist confidence (≥1.5). The quadratic weighted interrater confidence rating agreement was 95.2%, with a Gwet AC1 coefficient of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90-0.94) for the 1314 confidence ratings collected. The confidence agreement for each MOLEM class was 95.0% (class I), 93.5% (class II), 95.3% (class III), 96.5% (class IV), and 97.5% (class V). Conclusions and Relevance: The proposed MOLEM schema better reflects clinical practice than the MPATH-Dx schema in lesions excised to exclude melanoma by combining diagnoses with similar prognostic outcomes for melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions into standardized classification categories. Pathologists' level of confidence appeared to follow the MOLEM schema diagnostic concordance trend, ie, atypical naevi and melanoma in situ diagnoses were the least agreed upon and the most challenging for pathologists to confidently diagnose.. © 2021 American Medical Association.

S.",Factors influencing diagnostic accuracy among intensive care unit clinicians – an observational study,Diagnosis,"Objectives: Diagnostic errors are a source of morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, contextual factors influencing clinicians’ diagnostic performance have not been studied in authentic ICU settings. We sought to determine the accuracy of ICU clinicians’ diagnostic impressions and to characterize how various contextual factors, including self-reported stress levels and perceptions about the patient’s prognosis and complexity, impact diagnostic accuracy. We also explored diagnostic calibration, i.e. the balance of accuracy and confidence, among ICU clinicians. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study in an academic medical ICU. Between June and August 2019, we interviewed ICU clinicians during routine care about their patients’ diagnoses, their confidence, and other contextual factors. Subsequently, using adjudicated final diagnoses as the reference standard, two investigators independently rated clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy and on each patient on a given day (“patient-day”) using 5-point Likert scales. We conducted analyses using both restrictive and conservative definitions of clinicians’ accuracy based on the two reviewers’ ratings of accuracy. Results: We reviewed clinicians’ responses for 464 unique patient-days, which included 255 total patients. Attending physicians had the greatest diagnostic accuracy (77–90 %, rated as three or higher on 5-point Likert scale) followed by the team’s primary fellow (73–88 %). Attending physician and fellows were also least affected by contextual factors. Diagnostic calibration was greatest among ICU fellows. Conclusions: Additional studies are needed to better understand how contextual factors influence different clinicians’ diagnostic reasoning in the ICU. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

To examine whether physicians attend to gender prevalence data in diagnostic decision making for coronary heart disease (CHD) and to test the hypothesis that previously reported gender differences in CHD diagnostic certainty are due to discrimination arising from reliance on prevalence data (""statistical discrimination""). Data Sources. A vignette-based experiment of 256 randomly sampled primary care physicians conducted from 2006 to 2007. Study Design. Factorial experiment. Physicians observed patient presentations of cardinal CHD symptoms, standardized across design factors (gender, race, age, socioeconomic status). Data Collection. Structured interview. Principal Findings. Most physicians perceived the U.S. population CHD prevalence as higher in men (48.4 percent) or similar by gender (44.9 percent). For the observed patient, 52 percent did not change their CHD diagnostic certainty based on patient gender. Forty-eight percent of physicians were inconsistent in their population-level and individual-level CHD assessments. Physicians' assessments of CHD prevalence did not attenuate the observed gender effect in diagnostic certainty for the individual patient. Conclusions. Given an adequate presentation of CHD symptoms, physicians may deviate from their prevalence data during diagnostic decision making.

Compared with students, physicians had significantly higher levels of confidence, lower accuracy, and lower willingness to admit mistake. Although most respondents agreed in principle that errors should be disclosed, in the presented case, significantly less agreed to admit that a mistake might have occurred or to say so explicitly to the family. An association was found between overconfidence and discomfort with disclosure.

"Davis, D.P.; Campbell, C.J.; Poste, J.C.; Ma, G.",The association between operator confidence and accuracy of ultrasonography performed by novice emergency physicians,Journal of Emergency Medicine,"The variable accuracy of emergency department (ED) ultrasound described in the literature has limited its utility as the sole imaging modality in critical decision making. Although ultrasound accuracy is highly dependent upon the technical abilities of the operator and conditions unique to each patient, no previous study of ED ultrasound has included estimates of operator confidence. This prospective observational study explores the association between operator confidence and the accuracy of ED ultrasound. Ultrasound was not performed in our ED until a formal training module was instituted. Patients were enrolled prospectively for the first year following the training module if they underwent one of the following ultrasound studies: abdominal examination for intraperitoneal fluid, right upper quadrant examination for gallstones, renal examination for hydronephrosis, pelvic examination for intrauterine pregnancy, abdominal examination for aorta diameter > 3 cm, or cardiac examination for pericardial fluid. In addition, formal ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or an invasive procedure was required as a ""gold standard"" for each patient. Operators recorded their interpretation of the ED ultrasound and rated their confidence with the analysis before the formal imaging study or procedure. Test performance characteristics for each examination type and for all studies together were determined. The association between operator confidence and accuracy was explored using logistic regression and by determining test performance characteristics with patients stratified by confidence value. A total of 276 ED ultrasound studies were included. There were no significant differences in accuracy between ED attendings and residents. Overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, LR+, and LR- were 90%, 92%, 86%, 6.8, and 0.09, respectively. With confidence scores of 9 or 10 (n = 113), these values improved to 96%, 99%, 90%, 9.6, and 0.01, respectively. Logistic regression revealed an association between confidence and ED ultrasound accuracy (p < 0.001). It is concluded that a significant association exists between operator confidence and the accuracy of ED ultrasound.

Metacognition and the Diagnostic Process in Pathology,Medical Decision Making,"Background                   Metacognition is a cognitive process that involves self-awareness of thinking, understanding, and performance. This study assesses pathologists’ metacognition by examining the association between their diagnostic accuracy and self-reported confidence levels while interpreting skin and breast biopsies.                   Design                   We studied 187 pathologists from the Melanoma Pathology Study (M-Path) and 115 pathologists from the Breast Pathology Study (B-Path). We measured pathologists’ metacognitive ability by examining the area under the curve (AUC), the area under each pathologist’s receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve summarizing the association between confidence and diagnostic accuracy. We investigated possible relationships between this AUC measure, referred to as metacognitive sensitivity, and pathologist attributes. We also assessed whether higher metacognitive sensitivity affected the association between diagnostic accuracy and a secondary diagnostic action such as requesting a second opinion.                   Results                   We found no significant associations between pathologist clinical attributes and metacognitive AUC. However, we found that pathologists with higher AUC showed a stronger trend to request secondary diagnostic action for inaccurate diagnoses and not for accurate diagnoses compared with pathologists with lower AUC.                   Limitations                   Pathologists reported confidence in specific diagnostic terms, rather than the broader classes into which the diagnostic terms were later grouped to determine accuracy. In addition, while there is no gold standard for the correct diagnosis to determine the accuracy of pathologists’ interpretations, our studies achieved a high-quality reference diagnosis by using the consensus diagnosis of 3 experienced pathologists.                   Conclusions                   Metacognition can affect clinical decisions. If pathologists have self-awareness that their diagnosis may be inaccurate, they can request additional tests or second opinions, providing the opportunity to correct inaccurate diagnoses.                   Highlights                   Metacognitive sensitivity varied across pathologists, with most showing higher sensitivity than expected by chance.

G.; Nobili, F.",Comparing a Single Clinician Versus a Multidisciplinary Consensus Conference Approach for Dementia Diagnostics,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,"Background: Evidence-based recommendations on the optimal evaluation approach for dementia diagnostics are limited. This impedes a harmonized workup across clinics and nations. Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a multidisciplinary consensus conference compared to a single clinician approach. Methods: In this prospective study, we enrolled 457 patients with suspected cognitive decline, from two European memory clinics. A diagnostic evaluation was performed at baseline independently in two ways: 1) by a single clinician and 2) at a multidisciplinary consensus conference. A syndrome diagnosis and an etiological diagnosis was made. The confidence in the diagnosis was recorded using a visual analogue scale. An expert panel re-evaluation diagnosis served as reference for the baseline syndrome diagnosis and a 12-24-month follow-up diagnosis for the etiological diagnosis. Results: 439 patients completed the study. We observed 12.5%discrepancy (k=0.81) comparing the baseline syndrome diagnoses of the single clinician to the consensus conference, and 22.3%discrepancy (k=0.68) for the baseline etiological diagnosis. The accuracy of the baseline etiological diagnosis was significantly higher at the consensus conference and was driven mainly by increased accuracy in the MCI group. Confidence in the etiological diagnosis at baseline was significantly higher at the consensus conference (p<0.005), especially for the frontotemporal dementia diagnosis. Conclusion: The multidisciplinary consensus conference performed better on diagnostic accuracy of disease etiology and increased clinicians' confidence.

D.",The diagnostic certainty levels of junior clinicians: A retrospective cohort study,Health Information Management Journal,"Background: Clinical decision-making is influenced by many factors, including clinicians’ perceptions of the certainty around what is the best course of action to pursue. Objective: To characterise the documentation of working diagnoses and the associated level of real-time certainty expressed by clinicians and to gauge patient opinion about the importance of research into clinician decision certainty. Method: This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of non-consultant grade clinicians and their assessments of patients admitted from the emergency department between 01 March 2019 and 31 March 2019. De-identified electronic health record proformas were extracted that included the type of diagnosis documented and the certainty adjective used. Patient opinion was canvassed from a focus group. Results: During the study period, 850 clerking proformas were analysed; 420 presented a single diagnosis, while 430 presented multiple diagnoses. Of the 420 single diagnoses, 67 (16%) were documented as either a symptom or physical sign and 16 (4%) were laboratory-result-defined diagnoses. No uncertainty was expressed in 309 (74%) of the diagnoses. Of 430 multiple diagnoses, uncertainty was expressed in 346 (80%) compared to 84 (20%) in which no uncertainty was expressed. The patient focus group were unanimous in their support of this research. Conclusion: The documentation of working diagnoses is highly variable among non-consultant grade clinicians. In nearly three quarters of assessments with single diagnoses, no element of uncertainty was implied or quantified. More uncertainty was expressed in multiple diagnoses than single diagnoses. Implications: Increased standardisation of documentation will help future studies to better analyse and quantify diagnostic certainty in both single and multiple working diagnoses.

"Redelmeier, Donald A.; Shafir, Eldar",The Fallacy of a Single Diagnosis,Medical Decision Making,"Background                   Diagnostic reasoning requires clinicians to think through complex uncertainties. We tested the possibility of a bias toward an available single diagnosis in uncertain cases.                   Design                   We developed 5 different surveys providing a succinct description of a hypothetical individual patient scenaric. Each scenario was formulated in 2 versions randomized to participants, with the versions differing only in whether an alternative diagnosis was present or absent. The 5 scenarios were designed as separate tests of robustness using diverse cases, including a cautious scenario, a risky scenario, a sophisticated scenario, a validation scenario, and a comparative scenario (each survey containing only 1 version of 1 scenario). Participants included community members ( n = 1104) and health care professionals ( n = 200) who judged the chances of COVID infection in an individual patient.                   Results                   The first scenario described a cautious patient and found a 47% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID when a flu diagnosis was present compared with absent (odds ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.94, P = 0.003). The second scenario described a less cautious patient and found a 70% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID in the presence of a flu diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.70, P < 0.001). The third was a more sophisticated scenario presented to medical professionals and found a 73% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID in the presence of a mononucleosis diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.75, P < 0.001). Two further scenarios—avoiding mention of population norms—replicated the results.                   Limitations                   Brief hypothetical scenarios may overestimate the extent of bias in more complicated medical situations.                   Conclusions                   These results demonstrate that an available simple diagnosis can lead individuals toward premature closure and a failure to fully consider additional severe diseases.                   Highlights                   Occum’s razor has been debated for centuries yet rarely subjected to experimental testing for evidence-based medicine. This article offers direct evidence that people favor an available simple diagnosis, thereby neglecting to consider additional serious diseases. The bias can lead individuals to mistakenly lower their judged likelihood of COVID or another disease when an alternate diagnosis is present.

"Eva, Wayne Kevin",The influence of differentially processing evidence on diagnostic decision-making,Thesis,"By definition, the act of decision-making requires the consideration of multiple alternatives. Medical decision-making is no exception in that to decide whether or not a particular diagnosis is probably correct, a clinician must consider other diagnostic possibilities. Failure to do so is referred to as premature closure. If clinical instruction is provided regarding this diagnostic hazard, it tends to consist of advice to think of differential diagnoses before concluding one's diagnostic search. However, it is not yet known if such instruction is effective, let alone sufficient to eliminate diagnostic errors that arise from the tendency to under-weight non-focal hypotheses. I examined this issue by presenting case histories to experimental participants and manipulating the diagnoses that were explicitly presented with a request to assign probability ratings, a paradigm extensively used by Tversky and Koehler (1994). Fluctuations in the probability assessments provided an empirical measure of the degree to which diagnostic hypotheses were considered when they remained implicit in an ""all other diagnoses"" category. Results showed that diagnosticians tend to under-weight diagnostic alternatives that they are not explicitly asked to evaluate (Experiments 1 & 2). Furthermore, this effect does not solely arise from non-generation of alternative diagnoses. Diagnoses that medical students themselves generate are under-weighted relative to when the same diagnoses are presented explicitly (Experiment 3). By extension, this suggests that educational instruction to 'consider alternatives' is insufficient to help students eliminate premature closure. I hypothesized further that premature closure might result from a confirmation bias because the explicit presentation of a diagnostic alternative might cause diagnosticians to differentially process the evidence relevant to the diagnostic possibilities. That is, judges might focus their attention on the signs and symptoms of a case that are consistent with the diagnosis they are asked to evaluate at the expense of reducing consideration of the information consistent with other hypotheses. The results of Experiments 4 to 6 support this hypothesis. In these experiments it was found that participants who were prompted to re-evaluate the evidence were less susceptible to the biasing influence of the explicitly presented alternatives as long as this re-evaluation took place at the moment of decision-making. This was true even though no additional information was provided through prompting. Finally, additional factors that might lead to biased processing of the available evidence were examined. Formal medical terminology will cause differential processing, possibly because it is more mnemonically effective (Experiment 7). Diagnosticians are less susceptible to under-weighting non-focal alternatives when they themselves generate the focal hypotheses (Experiment 8). And finally, the diversion of attention created by the explicit mention of a specific diagnosis is not driven purely by an analytic shift of attention towards that particular diagnosis. Non-analytic influences are also influential (Experiment 9). The importance of these results for medical education and psychological theory of subjective probability is discussed.",2001,Yes,Presenting case histories ,Probability ratings,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Medical Students,No,,No,>200,,Differential Information Intervention,,"Underweighting of differentials not explicitly asked to consider early on, but is mitigated when explicitly considered or self-generated as differentials, increasing consideration of non consistent information"

The objective of our study was to prospectively determine how CT affects physicians' diagnostic certainty and management decisions in the setting of patients with nontraumatic abdominal complaints presenting to the emergency department. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. We included 584 patients presenting with nontraumatic abdominal complaints to the emergency department from November 2006 through February 2008. Emergency department clinicians were prospectively surveyed both before abdominal CT (pre-CT) and after abdominal CT (post-CT) to determine the leading diagnosis, the diagnostic certainty, and the management decisions. Changes were assessed by Fisher's exact test and the log likelihood ratio. RESULTS. The most common diagnoses were renal colic (119/584, 20.4%) and intestinal obstruction (80/584, 13.7%). CT altered the leading diagnosis in 49% of the patients (284/584, p < 0.00001) and increased mean physician diagnostic certainty from 70.5% (pre-CT) to 92.2% (post-CT) (p < 0.001; log likelihood ratio, 2.48). The management plan was changed by CT in 42% (244/583) (p < 0.0001). Physicians planned to admit 75.3% of the patients (440/584) to the hospital before CT; that plan was changed to hospital discharge with follow-up in 24.1% of patients (106/440) after CT. Surgery was planned for 79 patients before CT, whereas hospital discharge was planned for 25.3% of these patients (20/79) after CT. CONCLUSION. In the management of patients presenting to the emergency department with nontraumatic abdominal complaints, CT changes the leading diagnosis, increases diagnostic certainty, and changes potential patient management decisions. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",2011,No,Real patients presenting with abdo pain,0-100% certainty,Yes,"No, dynamic",No,No,No,No,No (not explicitly),Emergency Medicine,No,Mixed + all,Yes,584 (patients),Mixture,Imaging Increasing Confidence,,CT increase diagnostic certainty
