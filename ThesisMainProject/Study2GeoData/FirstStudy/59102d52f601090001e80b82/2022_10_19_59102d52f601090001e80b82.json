study was investigating how good people are at guessing countries based on information about said country.","DiagnosticApproach":"I try to choose the most common sense options to achieve my goal, such as picking \"Is the country landlocked?\" and \"How many countries border the country?\" as I feel those two help quite a bit in narrowing down which country it may be, however, I am very poor at international geography. South Korea was easy because it was not land-locked, in asia, and borders only one country, and is a full democracy."}}}
