not sure what the actual hypothesis of this study might be, however it seemed to be investigating relative knowledge of different areas of the world along with how people narrow down a large set of choices (often which they might not know much about) when given new information. Basically, an investigation of complex decision making when given a wide array of information.","DiagnosticApproach":"In most cases there were only a handful of pieces of information which were particularly helpful. For instance, whether the country was landlocked, number of bordering countries, size, etc.; so there were a few pieces of information that I picked out and focused on while I was coming up with a list of countries. In cases where I didn't know much about the potential countries involved (eg. landlocked countries Africa, Eastern Europe) I tried to err on the side of caution and just guess a lot of countries. Often there were one or two bits of cultural information or things to do with native plants and animals that made one or two of the countries stand out (eg. coffee and Colombia; Serbian ibix(?) and Mongolia). I don't know how I'd describe my overall strategy though; this was a complex task and I just tried to generate a good number of potential answers and revise them based on new information. I'd often go back to the previous information and realize I'd missed considering something, as well."},"decisionQuestions":[7,9,5,3,0,2,4,6,1,8],"decisionAnswers":{"RationalInfo":"Strongly

not sure what the actual hypothesis of this study might be, however it seemed to be investigating relative knowledge of different areas of the world along with how people narrow down a large set of choices (often which they might not know much about) when given new information. Basically, an investigation of complex decision making when given a wide array of information.","DiagnosticApproach":"In most cases there were only a handful of pieces of information which were particularly helpful. For instance, whether the country was landlocked, number of bordering countries, size, etc.; so there were a few pieces of information that I picked out and focused on while I was coming up with a list of countries. In cases where I didn't know much about the potential countries involved (eg. landlocked countries Africa, Eastern Europe) I tried to err on the side of caution and just guess a lot of countries. Often there were one or two bits of cultural information or things to do with native plants and animals that made one or two of the countries stand out (eg. coffee and Colombia; Serbian ibix(?) and Mongolia). I don't know how I'd describe my overall strategy though; this was a complex task and I just tried to generate a good number of potential answers and revise them based on new information. I'd often go back to the previous information and realize I'd missed considering something, as well."}}}
