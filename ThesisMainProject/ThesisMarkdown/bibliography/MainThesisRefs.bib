	abstract = {Background: Due to increasing bacterial resistance rates choosing a correct empiric antibiotic therapy is getting more and more complex. Often medical doctors use information tools to make the right treatment choice. Methods: One hundred sixty six participants (77 medical doctors and 89 medical students) were asked to provide a diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in a simple fictive paper case of upper urinary tract infection (UTI) in a randomized single-blinded study. Participants were randomized to one of four information tools they were allowed to use in the study or control: 1. free internet access, 2. pharmaceutical pocket guide, 3. pocket guide antibiotic therapy, 4. clinical decision support system (CDSS), and control (no information tool). The CDSS was designed for the study. The adherence to the national German UTI guideline was evaluated. Results: Only 27.1\% (n = 45/166) provided a correct diagnosis of upper UTI and 19.4\% (n = 32/166) an antibiotic treatment recommended by national German treatment guidelines indicating their need for information tools. This result was not significantly different between medical doctors and medical students, residents and medical specialists or level of working experience. Using CDSS improved results significantly compared to conventional tools (diagnosis 57.1\%; treatment recommendation 40.5\%; p {\textless} 0,01). Processing time was not different between the use of CDSS and conventional information tools. CDSS users based their decision making on their assigned information tool more than users of conventional tools (73.8\% vs. 48.0\%; p {\textless} 0.01). Using CDSS improved the confidence of participants in their recommendation significantly compared to conventional tools (p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions: Our study suggests that medical professionals require information tools in diagnosing and treating a simple case of upper UTI correctly. CDSS appears to be superior to conventional tools as an information source.},

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative surgical site infections (SSI) are common and costly. Most occur post discharge, and can result in potentially preventable readmission or unnecessary urgent evaluation. Mobile health approaches incorporating patient-generated wound photos are being implemented in an attempt to optimize triage and management. We assessed how adding wound photos to existing data sources modifies provider decision making. Study Design: We used a web-based simulation survey using a convenience sample of providers with expertise in surgical infections. Participants viewed a range of scenarios, including surgical history, physical exam, and description of wound appearance. All participants reported SSI diagnosis, diagnostic confidence, and management recommendations (main outcomes) first without, and then with, accompanying wound photos. At each step, participants ranked the most important features contributing to their decision. Results: Eighty-three participants completed a median of 5 scenarios (interquartile range 4 to 7). Most participants were physicians in academic surgical specialties (n=70 [84\%]). The addition of photos improved overall diagnostic accuracy from 67\% to 76\% (p{\textless}0.001), and increased specificity from 77\% to 92\% (p{\textless}0.001), but did not significantly increase sensitivity (55\% to 65\%; p=0.16). Photos increased mean confidence in diagnosis from 5.9 of 10 to 7.4 of 10 (p{\textless}0.001). Overtreatment recommendations decreased from 48\% to 16\% (p{\textless}0.001), and undertreatment did not change (28\% to 23\%; p=0.20) with the addition of photos. Conclusions: The addition of wound photos to existing data as available via chart review and telephone consultation with patients significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and confidence, and prevented proposed overtreatment in scenarios without SSI. Post-discharge mobile health technologies have the potential to facilitate patient-centered care, decrease costs, and improve clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In intensive care unit (ICU) patients, signs of infection and inflammation are similar, making diagnosis of bacterial infections difficult. Antimicrobials may therefore be overused, contributing to development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. OBJECTIVES: To measure the accuracy of clinician decisions to start antimicrobials; to correlate clinician certainty with the presence of infection; and to examine whether physiological variables correlate with clinician certainty. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Patients staying {\textgreater}48 hours in a general ICU of a tertiary care hospital. MEASUREMENTS: The ICU clinician's certainty for the presence of infection was recorded when starting antimicrobials. An independent infectious diseases (ID) specialist determined if antimicrobials were required and if infection was present. Clinician antibiotic start decisions were tested for accuracy according to the ID determination for the presence of infection. RESULTS: Empirical antimicrobial therapy was justified by the presence of infection on 67/125 (54\%) occasions. Clinician certainty for infection correlated well with the presence of defined infection (r2=0.78), however, infection was defined on 6/19 (31\%) occasions when ICU clinician certainty was low (2), and antimicrobials were prescribed even when clinician certainty was minimal. Antimicrobial course length was similar whether infection was defined or not (11.5+or-9.2 vs 10.7+or-9.1 days; P=0.65). Physiological variables were not associated with clinician certainty of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial therapy is probably overused in the ICU, possibly resulting from difficulties in diagnosis and the perceived greater risk of untreated infection when compared to the risks of potentially unnecessary antimicrobial therapy. Efforts to improve antimicrobial-related decision-making should be mandatory.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The available evidence on the use of heuristics and their relationship with diagnostic error in primary care is very limited. The aim of the study is to identify the use of unknown thought and specifically the possible use of Representativeness, Availability and overconfidence heuristics in the clinical practice of primary care physicians in cases of dyspnoea and to analyse their possible relationship with diagnostic error., METHODS: A total of 371 patients consulting with new episodes of dyspnoea in Primary Care centres in Spain were registered. Based on specific operational definitions, the use of unconscious thinking and the use of heuristics during the diagnostic process were assessed. Subsequently, the association between their use and diagnostic error was analysed., RESULTS: In 49.6\% of cases, the confirmatory diagnosis coincided with the first diagnostic impression, suggesting the use of the representativeness heuristic in the diagnostic decision process. In 82.3\% of the cases, the confirmatory diagnosis was among the three diagnostic hypotheses that were first identified by the general physicians, suggesting a possible use of the availability heuristic. In more than 50\% of the cases, the physicians were overconfident in the certainty of their own diagnosis. Finally, a diagnostic error was identified in 9.9\% of the recorded cases and no statistically significant correlation was found between the use of some unconscious thinking tools (such as the use of heuristics) and the diagnostic error., CONCLUSION: Unconscious thinking manifested through the acceptance of the first diagnostic impression and the use of heuristics is commonly used by primary care physicians in the clinical decision process in the face of new episodes of dyspnoea; however, its influence on diagnostic error is not significant. The proposed explicit and reproducible methodology may inspire further studies to confirm these results. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Objective: Cancer causes death to millions of people worldwide. Early detection of cancer in primary care may enhance patients' chances of survival. However, physicians often miss early cancers, which tend to present with undifferentiated symptoms. Within a theoretical framework of the hypothesis generation (HyGene) model, together with psychological literature, we studied how 2 factors-cancer prevalence and an alternative explanation for the patient's symptoms-impede early cancer detection, as well as prompt patient management. Method: Three hundred family physicians diagnosed and managed 2 patient cases, where cancer was a possible diagnosis (one colorectal cancer, the other lung cancer). We employed a 2 (cancer prevalence: low vs. high) x 2 (alternative explanation: present vs. absent) between-subjects design. Cancer prevalence was manipulated by changing either patient age or sex; the alternative explanation for the symptoms was manipulated by adding or removing a relevant clinical history. Each patient consulted twice. Results: In a series of random-intercept logistic models, both higher prevalence (OR = 1.92, 95\% confidence interval [CI 1.27, 2.92]) and absence of an alternative explanation (OR = 1.70, 95\% CI [1.11, 2.59]) increased the likelihood of a cancer diagnosis, which, in turn, increased the likelihood of prompt referral (OR = 22.84, 95\% CI [16.14, 32.32]). Conclusions: These findings confirm the probabilistic nature of the diagnosis generation process and validate the application of the HyGene model to early cancer detection. Increasing the salience of cancer-such as listing cancer as a diagnostic possibility-during the initial hypothesis generation phase may improve early cancer detection.

	abstract = {Medical judgment and decision-making frequently occur under conditions of uncertainty. In order to reduce the complexity of diagnosis, physicians often rely on cognitive heuristics. Use of heuristics during clinical reasoning can be effective; however when used inappropriately the result can be flawed reasoning, medical errors and patient harm. Many researchers have attempted to debias individuals from inappropriate heuristic use by designing interventions based on normative theories of decision-making. There have been few attempts to debias individuals using interventions based on descriptive decision-making theories. Objectives: (1) Assess use of Anchoring and Adjustment and Confirmation Bias during diagnostic reasoning; (2) Investigate the impact of heuristic use on diagnostic accuracy; (3) Determine the impact of a metacognitive intervention based on the Mental Model Theory designed to reduce biased judgment by inducing physicians to 'think about how they think'; and (4) Test a novel technique using eye-tracking to determine heuristic use and diagnostic accuracy within mode of thinking as defined by the Dual Process Theory. Methods: Medical students and residents assessed clinical scenarios using a computer system, specified a diagnosis, and designated the data used to arrive at the diagnosis. During case analysis, subjects either verbalized their thoughts or wore eye-tracking equipment to capture eye movements and pupil size as they diagnosed cases. Diagnostic data specified by the subject was used to measure heuristic use and assess the impact of heuristic use on diagnostic accuracy. Eye-tracking data was used to determine the frequency of heuristic use (Confirmation Bias only) and mode of thinking. Statistic models were executed to determine the effect of the metacognitive intervention. Results: Use of cognitive heuristics during diagnostic reasoning was common for this subject population. Logistic regression showed case difficulty to be an important factor contributing to diagnostic error. The metacognitive intervention had no effect on heuristic use and diagnostic accuracy. Eye-tracking data reveal this subject population infrequently assess cases in the Intuitive mode of thinking; spend more time in the Analytical mode of thinking, and switches between the two modes frequently as they reason through a case to arrive at a diagnosis.

	volume = {67},
	issn = {0419-4217},
	abstract = {Medical students must master several kinds of medical knowledge. In addition to knowledge of signs and symptoms, an understanding of the probabilities associated with disease and the likelihood of specific patterns of clinical findings, physicians must also have biomedical knowledge of underlying anatomy, physiology and biological mechanisms. The specific role of each form of knowledge and the relevance of certain types of knowledge to diagnostic decision-making and medical education is often debated. While there is general agreement that the acquisition of clinical knowledge is a key component of medical training, research into the value of biomedical knowledge has yielded little evidence supporting its value as an aid to diagnosis. I examined the role of biomedical knowledge through a series of experiments that required novice participants to learn a set of disease categories using either biomedical mechanisms or clinical knowledge as learning tools. The studies presented in this thesis provide evidence that knowledge of biomedical mechanisms can be used to identify the features of a disease category. For the novice diagnostician, the integration of features allows for a more coherent mental representation that is more memorable than the disease probabilities created by more quantitative decision aids. The results of several experiments demonstrate that students with an integrated understanding of mechanisms are better able to maintain diagnostic performance over time. This effect extended to very simple causal theories used to integrate the signs and symptoms of a disease category. When compared to a comprehensive list of features, knowledge of these simple theoretical connections led to an improvement in diagnostic performance over time. Consistent with the medical education literature, I have found that biomedical knowledge is not always necessary. Participants taught only the clinical features of disease initially achieved a level of diagnostic performance comparable to that attained by students with knowledge of underlying mechanisms. However this high level of diagnostic performance apparently occurs because knowledge of underlying mechanisms is not used immediately after learning. After a delay participants undergo a switch in processing and begin to make use of their knowledge of underlying mechanisms. In addition to delayed testing, I have found that students will make use of their knowledge of underlying mechanisms when challenged with difficult cases or with novel terminology.

To investigate whether these changes can bring about an improvement in health., METHODS: This was a prospective observational study on all patients referred to a regional unit for MRI of the knee over a 6-month-period. Data on diagnosis, diagnostic confidence and proposed management before MRI was compared with diagnoses and actual management after MRI. In addition, short form 36 item (SF-36) health survey data was collected at referral and again 6 months later., RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-two patients were entered into the study. MRI led to previously unsuspected diagnosis in 69 of 269 patients with available data. When MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis, significant improvements in clinicians' diagnostic confidence were found (P {\textless} 0.01 for medical meniscus, P {\textless} 0.05 lateral meniscus, P {\textless} 0.05 anterior cruciate). MRI led to a change in management in 180 (63\%) of 288 patients (where data available). There was a significant shift away from surgical management after MRI (P {\textless} 0.01). SF-36 results were available in 206 patients. There was a significant improvement over time in five of the eight SF-36 scales (four at P {\textless} 0.001, one at P {\textless} 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging significantly influences clinicians' diagnoses and management plans.

	abstract = {Background: Diagnostic errors have been attributed to reasoning flaws caused by cognitive biases. While experiments have shown bias to cause errors, physicians of similar expertise differed in susceptibility to bias. Resisting bias is often said to depend on engaging analytical reasoning, disregarding the influence of knowledge. We examined the role of knowledge and reasoning mode, indicated by diagnosis time and confidence, as predictors of susceptibility to anchoring bias. Anchoring bias occurs when physicians stick to an incorrect diagnosis triggered by early salient distracting features (SDF) despite subsequent conflicting information. Methods: Sixty-eight internal medicine residents from two Dutch university hospitals participated in a two-phase experiment. Phase 1: assessment of knowledge of discriminating features (ie, clinical findings that discriminate between lookalike diseases) for six diseases. Phase 2 (1 week later): diagnosis of six cases of these diseases. Each case had two versions differing exclusively in the presence/absence of SDF. Each participant diagnosed three cases with SDF (SDF+) and three without (SDF-). Participants were randomly allocated to case versions. Based on phase 1 assessment, participants were split into higher knowledge or lower knowledge groups. Main outcome measurements: frequency of diagnoses associated with SDF; time to diagnose; and confidence in diagnosis. Results: While both knowledge groups performed similarly on SDF- cases, higher knowledge physicians succumbed to anchoring bias less frequently than their lower knowledge counterparts on SDF+ cases (p=0.02). Overall, physicians spent more time (p{\textless}0.001) and had lower confidence (p=0.02) on SDF+ than SDF- cases (p{\textless}0.001). However, when diagnosing SDF+ cases, the groups did not differ in time (p=0.88) nor in confidence (p=0.96). Conclusions: Physicians apparently adopted a more analytical reasoning approach when presented with distracting features, indicated by increased time and lower confidence, trying to combat bias. Yet, extended deliberation alone did not explain the observed performance differences between knowledge groups. Success in mitigating anchoring bias was primarily predicted by knowledge of discriminating features of diagnoses. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024. No commercial re-use.

	abstract = {Background: Diagnostic errors are a major cause of preventable patient harm. Studies suggest that presenting inaccurate diagnostic suggestions can cause errors in physicians’ diagnostic reasoning processes. It is common practice for general practitioners (GPs) to suggest a diagnosis when referring a patient to secondary care. However, it remains unclear via which underlying processes this practice can impact diagnostic performance. This study therefore examined the effect of a diagnostic suggestion in a GP’s referral letter to the emergency department on the diagnostic performance of medical interns. Methods: Medical interns diagnosed six clinical cases formatted as GP referral letters in a randomized within-subjects experiment. They diagnosed two referral letters stating a main complaint without a diagnostic suggestion (control), two stating a correct suggestion, and two stating an incorrect suggestion. The referral question and case order were randomized. We analysed the effect of the referral question on interns’ diagnostic accuracy, number of differential diagnoses, confidence, and time taken to diagnose. Results: Forty-four medical interns participated. Interns considered more diagnoses in their differential without a suggested diagnosis (M = 1.85, SD = 1.09) than with a suggested diagnosis, independent of whether this suggestion was correct (M = 1.52, SD = 0.96, d = 0.32) or incorrect ((M = 1.42, SD = 0.97, d = 0.41), χ2(2) =7.6, p = 0.022). The diagnostic suggestion did not influence diagnostic accuracy (χ2(2) = 1.446, p = 0.486), confidence, (χ2(2) = 0.058, p = 0.971) or time to diagnose (χ2(2) = 3.128, p = 0.209). Conclusions: A diagnostic suggestion in a GPs referral letter did not influence subsequent diagnostic accuracy, confidence, or time to diagnose for medical interns. However, a correct or incorrect suggestion reduced the number of diagnoses considered. It is important for healthcare providers and teachers to be aware of this phenomenon, as fostering a broad differential could support learning. Future research is necessary to examine whether these findings generalize to other healthcare workers, such as more experienced specialists or triage nurses, whose decisions might affect the diagnostic process later on.

The aim of this study is to assess the proficiency and confidence of ED physicians with varying levels of experience in interpreting thoracic CT. Materials and methods: A total of 25 pathological and 5 normal thoracic CT images were interpreted by 32 ED residents, initially without clinical information, then with. After each session the participants were asked to score their confidence on a scale of 1 to 10. At the end of the study, the results were compared between seniors and junior residents. Results: The median age of the participants was 29 years (24-34). Twenty (62.5\%) of the residents were junior residents. There were no significant differences between the two resident groups in terms of accurate diagnosis rates, regardless of the clinical information (p=0.307 and p=0.061). The physicians’ certainty of their own diagnosis mostly does not seem to be statistically different in these diagnoses. The seniors are more confident in the diagnosis of the CT scans they evaluated without clinical information (p=0.004), while when the clinical information is added, the confidence of the junior physicians also increase (p=0.087). Conclusion: Both senior and junior emergency medical residents are able to interpret thoracic CT images with a high degree of accuracy, both for COVID-19 and for other emergency diagnoses. Senior physicians were confident in their decisions regardless of whether they are accurate or not, solely by visual inspection, whereas junior residents displayed similar confidence when clinical information was available. © 2023, Pamukkale University.

Since early HF symptoms are ambiguous, doctors may overlook HF as possible cause and misinterpret the signs. The aim was to analyse differences in general practitioners' (GPs) HF diagnosis and diagnostic certainty by patient age and gender and to identify reasons for possible differences. Design Factorial design with video vignettes presenting patients (played by professional actors) with early HF symptoms was used. Video vignettes differed regarding patients' gender (male/female), age (55 years/75 years) and migration background (no/yes: Turkish), while the dialogue was identical. GPs were asked about possible diagnoses and certainty of diagnoses (quantitative) and to narrate their thoughts on considered diagnoses (qualitative). Setting General practices in northern Germany. Participants 128 GPs stratified by gender and length of clinical experience (≤15 years or {\textgreater}15 years). Results GPs considered HF more often in women than men (predicted probabilities with 95\% CI: 0.83 (0.68 to 0.92) vs 0.63 (0.44 to 0.79), p=0.02), especially in older women compared with younger men (predicted probabilities with 95\% CI: 0.89 (0.68 to 0.96) vs 0.52 (0.31 to 0.72), p=0,03). Suspected HF was not reasoned by the patient's gender and only seldom by the patient's age, but by reported symptoms. Diagnostic certainty of HF was higher in women than in men (predicted proportions with 95\% CI: 0.48 (0.39 to 0.58) vs 0.36 (0.27 to 0.45), p=0.01), with highest certainty in older women and lowest in younger men (0.57 (0.45 to 0.69) vs 0.27 (0.17 to 0.37), p{\textless}0.01). GPs explained their certainty referring to both typical HF symptoms and their gut feeling. Conclusion Despite an identical dialogue, the study showed differences by patients' gender and age in frequency and certainty of HF diagnosis. In order to avoid that GPs overlook or misinterpret early signs of HF, it is important to critically reflect diagnostic decisions and possible social influences. ©},

	abstract = {Background: Recovery of consciousness is the most important survival factor in patients with acute brain injury and disorders of consciousness (DoC). Since most deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU) occur after withdrawal of life-support, medical decision-making is crucial for acute DoC patients. Neuroimaging informs decision-making, yet the precise effects of MRI on decision-making in the ICU are poorly understood. We investigated the impact of brain MRI on prognostication, therapeutic decisions and physician confidence in ICU patients with DoC. Methods: In this simulated decision-making study utilizing a prospective ICU cohort, a panel of neurocritical experts first reviewed clinical information (without MRI) from 75 acute DoC patients and made decisions about diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Following review of the MRI, the panel then decided if the initial decisions needed revision. In parallel, a blinded neuroradiologist reassessed all neuroimaging. Results: MRI led to changes in clinical management of 57 (76\%) of patients (Number-Needed-to-Test for any change: 1.32), including revised diagnoses (20\%), levels of care (21\%), diagnostic confidence (43\%) and prognostications (33\%). Decisions were revised more often with stroke than with other brain injuries (p = 0.02). However, although MRI revealed additional pathology in 81\%, this did not predict revised clinical decision-making (p-values ≥0.08). Conclusion: MRI results changed decision-making in 3 of 4 ICU patients, but radiological findings were not predictive of clinical decision-making. This highlights the need to better understand the effects of neuroimaging on management decisions. How MRI influences decision-making in the ICU is an important avenue for research to improve acute DoC management. © 2022},

Twenty-one radiologists dictated their findings on 16 deidentified musculoskeletal radiographic cases while wearing a mobile-eye tracking system.

Experienced radiologists outperformed less-experienced participants, but no systematic differences in gaze behaviors emerged between groups.

	abstract = {Background Multimorbidity can be defined as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic medical conditions in one person. Within the diagnostic process, accurately detecting a multimorbid disease pattern still poses a major challenge for most physicians, and is known as a source of diagnostic uncertainty. Objective We investigated, how sensitive, confident, and accurate physicians are in diagnosing multimorbid versus monomorbid patients. Methods We created eight video case-based vignettes, which differed in type of morbidity (multimorbid versus monomorbid), field of medical specialization (somatic versus mental), and relatedness of underlying diseases (causally related versus unrelated). In total, 74 physicians (GPs, residents in an emergency department and psychiatrists) watched three to five randomly allocated video cases and had to generate suspected diagnoses at the end of each of three video sequences. Additionally, participating physicians rated subjective confidence for all mentioned diagnoses and for three sequences per case with the help of confidence profiles. Results Altogether, physicians made a large number of accurate diagnoses (69\%). Nevertheless, the overall number of underdiagnosed multimorbid cases (misses) was significantly higher (71\%) than over-diagnosed monomorbid cases (false alarms) (7\%). Discussion According to Signal Detection Theory, GPs and psychiatrists both showed lower detection performance for medical cases that lay beyond their own field of specialization. Remarkably, residents show the highest sensitivity for multimorbid cases with an approximately identically detection performance d’ slightly over 1 for both field of medical specialization (somatic and mental). Furthermore, higher uncertainty in diagnosing multimorbid cases is related to lower confidence especially at the beginning of a diagnostic process, as well as to unrelated and therefore probably rare disease pattern. Several limitations of the study and the video case-based vignettes are described within the discussion section. Conclusions Physicians have to be sensitized for multimorbidity even more, and have to be taught in the prevalence of existing disease combinations. Communicating uncertainty with other specialists could be helpful when faced with a sometimes “fuzzy” pattern of symptoms. © 2019 Hausmann et al.

	abstract = {Background: Guided reflection interventions, in an effort to reduce diagnostic error, encourage diagnosticians to generate alternative diagnostic hypotheses and gather confirming and disconfirming evidence before making a final diagnosis. This method has been found to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy in recent studies; however, it requires a significant investment of time, and psychological theory suggests the possibility for unintended consequences owing to cognitive bias. This study compared a short and long version of a guided reflection task on improvements in diagnostic accuracy, change in diagnostic confidence, and rates of corrected diagnoses. Methods: One hundred and eighty-six fourth- and fifth-year medical students diagnosed a series of fictional clinical cases, by first impressions (control condition) or by using a short or long guided reflection process, and rated their confidence in their initial diagnostic hypothesis at intervals throughout the process. In the "short" condition, participants were asked to generate two alternatives to their initial diagnostic hypothesis; in the "long" condition, six alternatives were required. Results: The reflective intervention did not elicit more accurate final diagnoses than diagnosis based on first impressions only. Participants who completed a short version of the task performed similarly to those who completed a long version. Neither the short nor long form elicited significant changes in diagnostic confidence from the beginning to the end of the diagnostic process, nor did the conditions differ on the rate of corrected diagnoses. Conclusions: This study finds no evidence to support the use of the guided reflection method as a diagnostic aid for novice diagnosticians, who may already use an analytical approach to diagnosis and therefore derive less benefit from this intervention than their more experienced colleagues. The results indicate some support for a shorter, less demanding version of the process, and further study is now required to identify the most efficient process to recommend to doctors. © 2018 Lambe, Hevey and Kelly.},

	abstract = {Background: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) diagnosis, performed by a physician at the patient bedside, is routinely used in emergency medicine and critical care. Although training in ultrasonography has become part of the medical school curriculum, POCUS can be challenging for medical students. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a one-day POCUS course in a group of final-year medical students by pre-course and post-course assessment of both diagnostic ability and changes in student confidence levels in making a diagnosis. Material/Methods: A prospective study recruited 57 final-year medical students who participated in a one-day POCUS course. Improvement in making decisions and levels of confidence were evaluated before and two weeks after the course, using image-based testing and a self- evaluation questionnaire. Results: All 57 final-year medical students attended the course and completed the tests and surveys. The pre-training and post-training test scores of medical students improved from 41.78±12\% to 58±13\%. Student confidence scores in the post-training assessment significantly increased. The post-training confidence scores were significantly increased compared with the pre-training scores regardless of whether or not the questions were answered correctly (p{\textless}0.001). The Dunning-Kruger effect, or cognitive bias, might partially explain this phenomenon. Conclusions: One day of POCUS training integrated into anesthesia curriculum for final-year medical students improved performance in the post-training test scores and improved their confidence scores. Further studies are needed to evaluate this effect and to develop adequate tools to assess medical students. © Med Sci Monit, 2019.},

	abstract = {Introduction The 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) presents a plethora of information and demands extensive knowledge and a high cognitive workload to interpret. Whilst the ECG is an important clinical tool, it is frequently incorrectly interpreted. Even expert clinicians are known to impulsively provide a diagnosis based on their first impression and often miss co-abnormalities. Given it is widely reported that there is a lack of competency in ECG interpretation, it is imperative to optimise the interpretation process. Predominantly the ECG interpretation process remains a paper based approach and whilst computer algorithms are used to assist interpreters by providing printed computerised diagnoses, there are a lack of interactive human-computer interfaces to guide and assist the interpreter. Methods An interactive computing system was developed to guide the decision making process of a clinician when interpreting the ECG. The system decomposes the interpretation process into a series of interactive sub-tasks and encourages the clinician to systematically interpret the ECG. We have named this model ‘Interactive Progressive based Interpretation’ (IPI) as the user cannot ‘progress’ unless they complete each sub-task. Using this model, the ECG is segmented into five parts and presented over five user interfaces (1: Rhythm interpretation, 2: Interpretation of the P-wave morphology, 3: Limb lead interpretation, 4: QRS morphology interpretation with chest lead and rhythm strip presentation and 5: Final review of 12-lead ECG). The IPI model was implemented using emerging web technologies (i.e. HTML5, CSS3, AJAX, PHP and MySQL). It was hypothesised that this system would reduce the number of interpretation errors and increase diagnostic accuracy in ECG interpreters. To test this, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians when they used the standard approach (control cohort) with clinicians who interpreted the same ECGs using the IPI approach (IPI cohort). Results For the control cohort, the (mean; standard deviation; confidence interval) of the ECG interpretation accuracy was (45.45\%; SD = 18.1\%; CI = 42.07, 48.83). The mean ECG interpretation accuracy rate for the IPI cohort was 58.85\% (SD = 42.4\%; CI = 49.12, 68.58), which indicates a positive mean difference of 13.4\%. (CI = 4.45, 22.35) An N − 1 Chi-square test of independence indicated a 92\% chance that the IPI cohort will have a higher accuracy rate. Interpreter self-rated confidence also increased between cohorts from a mean of 4.9/10 in the control cohort to 6.8/10 in the IPI cohort (p = 0.06). Whilst the IPI cohort had greater diagnostic accuracy, the duration of ECG interpretation was six times longer when compared to the control cohort. Conclusions We have developed a system that segments and presents the ECG across five graphical user interfaces. Results indicate that this approach improves diagnostic accuracy but with the expense of time, which is a valuable resource in medical practice. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

It remains unclear, however, whether EHR indeed fulfills this claim under the severe time constraints of Emergency Departments (EDs). We assessed whether accessing EHR in an ED actually improves decision-making by clinicians. A simulated ED environment was created at the Israel Center for Medical Simulation (MSR). Four different actors were trained to simulate four specific complaints and behavior and 'consulted' 26 volunteer ED physicians. Each physician treated half of the cases (randomly) with access to EHR, and their medical decisions were compared to those where the physicians had no access to EHR. Comparison of diagnostic accuracy with and without access showed that accessing the EHR led to an increase in the quality of the clinical decisions. Physicians accessing EHR were more highly informed and thus made more accurate decisions. The percentage of correct diagnoses was higher and these physicians were more confident in their diagnoses and made their decisions faster. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Designers of computerised diagnostic support systems (CDSSs) expect physicians to notice when they need advice and enter into the CDSS all information that they have gathered about the patient. The poor use of CDSSs and the tendency not to follow advice once a leading diagnosis emerges would question this expectation. Aim: To determine whether providing GPs with diagnoses to consider before they start testing hypotheses improves accuracy. Design and setting: Mixed factorial design, where 297 GPs diagnosed nine patient cases, differing in difficulty, in one of three experimental conditions: control, early support, or late support. Method: Data were collected over the internet. After reading some initial information about the patient and the reason for encounter, GPs requested further information for diagnosis and management. Those receiving early support were shown a list of possible diagnoses before gathering further information. In late support, GPs first gave a diagnosis and were then shown which other diagnoses they could still not discount. Results: Early support significantly improved diagnostic accuracy over control (odds ratio [OR] 1.31; 95\% confidence interval [95\%CI] = 1.03 to 1.66, P?=?0.027), while late support did not (OR 1.10; 95\% CI = 0.88 to 1.37). An absolute improvement of 6\% with early support was obtained. There was no significant interaction with case difficulty and no effect of GP experience on accuracy. No differences in information search were detected between experimental conditions. Conclusion: Reminding GPs of diagnoses to consider before they start testing hypotheses can improve diagnostic accuracy irrespective of case difficulty, without lengthening information search.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To assess whether adding a novel computerised diagnostic tool, the MoleMate system (SIAscopy with primary care scoring algorithm), to current best practice results in more appropriate referrals of suspicious pigmented lesions to secondary care, and to assess its impact on clinicians and patients. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: 15 general practices in eastern England. Participants: 1297 adults with pigmented skin lesions not immediately diagnosed as benign. Interventions: Patients were assessed by trained primary care clinicians using best practice (clinical history, naked eye examination, seven point checklist) either alone (control group) or with the MoleMate system (intervention group). Main outcome measures: Appropriateness of referral, defined as the proportion of referred lesions that were biopsied or monitored. Secondary outcomes related to the clinicians (diagnostic performance, confidence, learning effects) and patients (satisfaction, anxiety). Economic evaluation, diagnostic performance of the seven point checklist, and five year follow-up of melanoma incidence were also secondary outcomes and will be reported later. Results: 1297 participants with 1580 lesions were randomised: 643 participants with 788 lesions to the intervention group and 654 participants with 792 lesions to the control group. The appropriateness of referral did not differ significantly between the intervention or control groups: 56.8\% (130/229) v 64.5\% (111/172); difference -8.1\% (95\% confidence interval -18.0\% to 1.8\%). The proportion of benign lesions appropriately managed in primary care did not differ (intervention 99.6\% v control 99.2\%, P=0.46), neither did the percentage agreement with an expert decision to biopsy or monitor (intervention 98.5\% v control 95.7\%, P=0.26). The percentage agreement with expert assessment that the lesion was benign was significantly lower with MoleMate (intervention 84.4\% v control 90.6\%, P{\textless}0.001), and a higher proportion of lesions were referred (intervention 29.8\% v control 22.4\%, P=0.001). Thirty six histologically confirmed melanomas were diagnosed: 18/18 were appropriately referred in the intervention group and 17/18 in the control group. Clinicians in both groups were confident, and there was no evidence of learning effects, and therefore contamination, between groups. Patients in the intervention group ranked their consultations higher for thoroughness and reassuring care, although anxiety scores were similar between the groups. Conclusions: We found no evidence that the MoleMate system improved appropriateness of referral. The systematic application of best practice guidelines alone was more accurate than the MoleMate system, and both performed better than reports of current practice. Therefore the systematic application of best practice guidelines (including the seven point checklist) should be the paradigm for management of suspicious skin lesions in primary care.},

Here, we performed an add-on questionnaire study to evaluate the relevance of florbetaben imaging (BAY 949172) in diagnosis and consecutive management of probable AD patients. Methods: AD patients with a clinical diagnosis in accordance with the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria or controls were imaged using florbetaben. Referring physicians were asked on a voluntary basis about their confidence in initial diagnosis, significance of PET imaging results, and their anticipated consequences for future patient care. Results: 121 questionnaires for probable AD patients and 80 questionnaires for controls were evaluated. In 18\% of patients who had initially received the diagnosis of probable AD, PET scans were rated negative, whereas in controls 18\% of scans were positive. An increase in confidence in the initial diagnosis was frequently reported (80\%). Imaging results had a significant impact on the intended patient care, as judged by the referring physicians; this was most prominent in those patients with a contradicting scan and/or a low confidence in the initial diagnosis.

To examine whether physicians attend to gender prevalence data in diagnostic decision making for coronary heart disease (CHD) and to test the hypothesis that previously reported gender differences in CHD diagnostic certainty are due to discrimination arising from reliance on prevalence data ("statistical discrimination"). Data Sources. A vignette-based experiment of 256 randomly sampled primary care physicians conducted from 2006 to 2007. Study Design. Factorial experiment. Physicians observed patient presentations of cardinal CHD symptoms, standardized across design factors (gender, race, age, socioeconomic status). Data Collection. Structured interview. Principal Findings. Most physicians perceived the U.S. population CHD prevalence as higher in men (48.4 percent) or similar by gender (44.9 percent). For the observed patient, 52 percent did not change their CHD diagnostic certainty based on patient gender. Forty-eight percent of physicians were inconsistent in their population-level and individual-level CHD assessments. Physicians' assessments of CHD prevalence did not attenuate the observed gender effect in diagnostic certainty for the individual patient. Conclusions. Given an adequate presentation of CHD symptoms, physicians may deviate from their prevalence data during diagnostic decision making. Physicians' priors on CHD prevalence did not explain the gender effect in CHD certainty. Future research should examine personal stereotypes as an explanation for gender differences. © Health Research and Educational Trust.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to prospectively determine how CT affects physicians' diagnostic certainty and management decisions in the setting of patients with nontraumatic abdominal complaints presenting to the emergency department. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. We included 584 patients presenting with nontraumatic abdominal complaints to the emergency department from November 2006 through February 2008. Emergency department clinicians were prospectively surveyed both before abdominal CT (pre-CT) and after abdominal CT (post-CT) to determine the leading diagnosis, the diagnostic certainty, and the management decisions. Changes were assessed by Fisher's exact test and the log likelihood ratio. RESULTS. The most common diagnoses were renal colic (119/584, 20.4\%) and intestinal obstruction (80/584, 13.7\%). CT altered the leading diagnosis in 49\% of the patients (284/584, p {\textless} 0.00001) and increased mean physician diagnostic certainty from 70.5\% (pre-CT) to 92.2\% (post-CT) (p {\textless} 0.001; log likelihood ratio, 2.48). The management plan was changed by CT in 42\% (244/583) (p {\textless} 0.0001). Physicians planned to admit 75.3\% of the patients (440/584) to the hospital before CT; that plan was changed to hospital discharge with follow-up in 24.1\% of patients (106/440) after CT. Surgery was planned for 79 patients before CT, whereas hospital discharge was planned for 25.3\% of these patients (20/79) after CT. CONCLUSION. In the management of patients presenting to the emergency department with nontraumatic abdominal complaints, CT changes the leading diagnosis, increases diagnostic certainty, and changes potential patient management decisions. © American Roentgen Ray Society.},

	abstract = {Background. Earlier reports suggest limited clinical reasoning and substantial uncertainty of GPs in assessing patients suspected of dementia. Objective. To explore the predictors of GPs to decide on the presence and absence of dementia as well as the predictors of diagnostic confidence of GPs. Design. An observational study was set up among 107 patients of 64 GPs. The GPs were instructed to use the Dutch national dementia guideline on consecutive patients newly suspected of dementia and to register their assessment on a detailed form. The predictors of the presence and absence of dementia according to the GPs and their diagnostic confidence were explored by logistic regression analyses. Main outcome measures. Dependent variables: (i) presence and absence of dementia according to GPs and (ii) diagnostic confidence. Independent variables: clinical (cognitive, behavioural, somatic, functional), applications of recommendations, patient related and GP related. Results. Dementia was diagnosed in 67\% of the suspected patients. The presence of dementia according to the GPs was positively associated with observed impairment of the higher cognitive functions, absence of depression and female gender of patients. The GPs expressed diagnostic confidence in 58\% of the cases. This was positively associated with application of recommendations, ADL dependency, longer duration, informant availability, restless behaviour and a patient's female gender. Use of the Mini Mental Status Examination was not associated with confidence. Conclusions. GPs seem to base the diagnosis of dementia on rational grounds. Application of the dementia guideline's recommendations may contribute to more diagnostic confidence. © The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether short-training-based dermoscopy increases confidence in the diagnosis of skin lesions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: After a 1-hour course on dermoscopy, 20 pairs of clinical and dermoscopic images of lesions were presented to 19 dermatology residents with little or no dermoscopy experience. After viewing the clinical image, they were asked to assess their confidence in the diagnosis in a seven-point scale, with 1 reflecting that the respondent was 100\% confident that the lesion was benign, while number 7 reflected 100\% confidence that it was malignant. The same technique was used for dermoscopic images. RESULTS: Ten of the 20 pairs of evaluations showed a significant difference (p{\textless}.05). The largest differences were observed in lesions where clinical scores suggested that participants were uncertain about the diagnosis, but tended to decide that the lesion was benign after dermoscopy. Dermoscopy did not improve confidence in the evaluation of dysplastic lesions as well as lesions with obvious clinical diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Short-training-based dermoscopy improved confidence in the diagnosis of clinically challenging skin lesions, but the impact was not demonstrable for clinically obvious lesions and dysplastic nevi. © 2006 by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Inc.

We investigate the question of how physicians react when faced with decision support suggestions that contradict their own diagnoses. We used a study design involving 52 volunteer dermatologists who each rated the malignancy of 25 lesion images on an ordinal scale and gave a dichotomous excise/no excise recommendation for each lesion image. After seeing the system's rating and excise suggestions, the physicians could revise their initial recommendations. We observed that in 24\% of the cases in which the physicians' diagnoses did not match those of the decision support system, the physicians changed their diagnoses. There was a slight but significant negative correlation between susceptibility to change and experience level of the physicians. Physicians were significantly less likely to follow the decision system's recommendations when they were confident of their initial diagnoses. No differences between the physicians' inclinations to following excise versus no excise recommendations could be observed. These results indicate that physicians are quite susceptible to accepting the recommendations of decision support systems, and that quality assurance and validation of such systems is therefore of paramount importance. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The variable accuracy of emergency department (ED) ultrasound described in the literature has limited its utility as the sole imaging modality in critical decision making. Although ultrasound accuracy is highly dependent upon the technical abilities of the operator and conditions unique to each patient, no previous study of ED ultrasound has included estimates of operator confidence. This prospective observational study explores the association between operator confidence and the accuracy of ED ultrasound. Ultrasound was not performed in our ED until a formal training module was instituted. Patients were enrolled prospectively for the first year following the training module if they underwent one of the following ultrasound studies: abdominal examination for intraperitoneal fluid, right upper quadrant examination for gallstones, renal examination for hydronephrosis, pelvic examination for intrauterine pregnancy, abdominal examination for aorta diameter {\textgreater} 3 cm, or cardiac examination for pericardial fluid. In addition, formal ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or an invasive procedure was required as a "gold standard" for each patient. Operators recorded their interpretation of the ED ultrasound and rated their confidence with the analysis before the formal imaging study or procedure. Test performance characteristics for each examination type and for all studies together were determined. The association between operator confidence and accuracy was explored using logistic regression and by determining test performance characteristics with patients stratified by confidence value. A total of 276 ED ultrasound studies were included. There were no significant differences in accuracy between ED attendings and residents. Overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, LR+, and LR- were 90\%, 92\%, 86\%, 6.8, and 0.09, respectively. With confidence scores of 9 or 10 (n = 113), these values improved to 96\%, 99\%, 90\%, 9.6, and 0.01, respectively. Logistic regression revealed an association between confidence and ED ultrasound accuracy (p {\textless} 0.001). It is concluded that a significant association exists between operator confidence and the accuracy of ED ultrasound. High confidence values are associated with clinically useful test performance characteristics. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.},

Methods. An experiment was conducted in which 16 (= 24) videotapes portraying patient-physician encounters for two medical conditions (polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and depression) were randomly assigned to physicians for viewing. Each video presented a combination of four patient attributes (65 years or 80 years of age; male or female; black or white; blue or white collar occupation). Steps were taken to enhance external validity. One hundred twenty-eight eligible physicians were sampled from the northeastern United States, with numbers balanced across 16 (= 24) strata generated from the following characteristics (male or female; {\textless} 15 or ≥ 15 years since graduation; black or white; internists or family practitioners). The outcomes studied were: 1) the most likely diagnosis; 2) level of certainty adhering to that diagnosis; and 3) the number of tests that would be ordered. Results. Patient attributes (namely age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status) had no influence on the three outcomes studied (the most likely diagnosis, the level of certainty, and test ordering behavior). This was consistent across the two medical conditions portrayed (PMR and depression). In contrast, characteristics of physicians (namely their medical specialty, race, and age) interactively influenced medical decision-making. Conclusion. Epidemiologically important patient attributes (which Bayesian decision theorists hold should be influential) had no effect on medical decision-making for the two conditions, while clinically extraneous physician characteristics (which should not be influential) had a statistically significant effect. The validity of idealized theoretical approaches to medical decision making and the usefulness of further observational approaches are discussed.},

	abstract = {The process of clinical decision support is linked to the validity of clinicians' confidence in their judgments. Clinicians who are appropriately confident - highly confident when they are correct and less confident when they are incorrect - will access computer-based and other information resources only when they are needed. Clinicians who are consistently underconfident will rely on external resources when they are not needed. Those who are overconfident, who believe they are correct when in fact they are not, will be prone to medical errors. An extensive literature indicates a general tendency toward overconfidence in human judgment. This study explores the relationship between confidence and 'correctness', across three levels of clinical experience, in the task domain of diagnosis in internal medicine. We created detailed synopses of 36 diagnostically challenging cases and divided them into four equivalent sets of nine cases each. We asked 216 subjects at three experience levels (72 senior medical students, 72 senior medical residents, and 72 faculty attendings) to generate a differential diagnosis for each of the nine cases in one randomly-assigned set, and simultaneously to indicate their level of confidence in each of their diagnoses. We then examined the relationship between the correctness of these diagnoses (the appearance of the correct diagnosis anywhere in the hypothesis list) and these confidence judgments, for all subjects and separately for subjects at each experience level. Results indicate a small but statistically significant relationship associating correctness with higher confidence for all subjects (Kendall 's τb = -.106; p {\textless}.0001). This statistical relationship is strongest for the students (τb = -.121;p {\textless}.001), somewhat lesser but still significant for the faculty-level attendings (τb = -.103; p {\textless}.005), and non-significant (τb =-.041) for the residents. (The negative correlations are a coding artifact.) Subjects in this study showed a tendency toward underconfidence: they had low confidence in correct diagnoses more often than they had high confidence when wrong. Nonetheless, they were overconfident and thus 'error prone' for 17\% of cases overall. The medical students were possibly overmatched by the difficulty of the cases, so their concordance between confidence and correctness may have resulted from an awareness that they were often guessing. The relatively low concordance seen in the residents and attendings makes a strong argument that decision support systems to reduce medical errors should include both 'push' and 'pull' models. In sum, these results indicate that medical decision support systems cannot rely exclusively on clinicians' perceptions of their information needs, as such perceptions will frequently be incorrect. © 2001 IMIA.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of evacuation proctography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven referring clinicians completed preevacuation proctography questionnaires for 50 patients, detailing diagnoses, confidence in these, intended management, and what they hoped to learn. After evacuation proctography, the radiology report was returned with a second questionnaire asking the diagnosis in the light of evacuation proctographic findings, their confidence, and what they had learned. Clinicians quantified management contribution and indicated how useful they found evacuation proctography in general. Results from pre- and post-evacuation proctography questionnaires were compared to determine the diagnostic and therapeutic effects. RESULTS: Diagnostic confidence rose significantly after evacuation proctography (mean, 7.0 before evacuation proctography vs 8.4 after evacuation proctography; P {\textless} .001). Lead diagnosis changed in nine (18\%) patients. Intended surgical management became nonsurgical after evacuation proctography in seven (14\%) patients, and intended nonsurgical therapy became surgical in two (4\%). Surgery remained likely in 15 patients, but its nature changed in five (10\%). Five (10\%) clinicians stated that evacuation proctographic findings resolved diagnostic conflict, and nine (18\%) found that evacuation proctographic findings revealed unsuspected diagnoses. Clinicians found evacuation proctography of major benefit in 20 (40\%) cases studied and of moderate benefit in 20 (40\%). In general, 20 (43\%) clinicians found evacuation proctography very useful and 24 (51\%) found it moderately useful. CONCLUSION: Evacuation proctography has a substantial diagnostic and therapeutic effect and is of considerable benefit to referring clinicians.},

Methods: A national sample (N = 108) of 67 internists, 35 family physicians, and 6 other U.S. physicians used QMR to assist in the diagnosis of written clinical cases. Three sets of eight cases stratified by diagnostic difficulty and the potential of QMR to produce high-quality information were used. A 2 x 2 repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test whether these factors were associated with perceived usefulness of QMR and physicians' diagnostic confidence after using QMR. Correlations were computed among physician characteristics, ratings of QMR usefulness, and physicians' confidence in their own diagnoses, and between usefulness or confidence and actual diagnostic performance. Results: The analyses showed that QMR was perceived to be significantly more useful (P {\textless} 0.05) on difficult cases, on cases where QMR could provide high-quality information, by non-board-certified physicians, and when diagnostic confidence was lower. Diagnostic confidence was higher when comfort with using certain QMR functions was higher. The ratings of usefulness or diagnostic confidence were not consistently correlated with diagnostic performance. Conclusions: The results suggest that users' diagnostic confidence and perceptions of QMR usefulness may be associated more with their need for decision support than with their actual diagnostic performance when using the system. Evaluators may fail to find a diagnostic decision support system useful if only easy cases are tested, if correct diagnoses are not in the system's knowledge base, or when only highly trained physicians use the system.},

Randomized controlled trial. Setting. Primary care physicians' outpatient clinics in or near the Minneap olis/St. Paul metropolitan area. Participants. Forty family physicians and general internists who were members of either of two large consortia of clinics. Intervention. Subjects evaluated ten clinical vignettes accompanied by ECGs and reported their diagnostic impressions. The vignettes were based on actual patient visits. Half of the subjects received ECGs with computer-generated reports, the other half received the same ECGs without reports. Main outcome measures. ECG reading time; agreement with the clinical diagnosis; agreement with the computer report; diagnostic confidence. Results. The subjects receiving the reports were more likely to agree with the clinical diagnoses of the original cases, particularly for two vignettes in which the diagnoses were uncommon and were mentioned in the reports. The subjects receiving the reports were also more likely to make diagnoses that were consistent with the reports, even when the reports were erroneous. Those receiving the reports spent, on average, 15 seconds less time looking at each ECG, a 25\% decrease. Conclusions. In simulated cases, primary care physicians appear to use computer interpre tations of ECGs when available, as shown by enhanced diagnostic accuracy and modestly reduced time spent reading the tracings. However, erroneous reports may mislead physi cians. Since the effects of computerized ECG interpretation do not appear to have been uniformly favorable in this mock-clinical setting, it will be important to evaluate the effects of this technology in actual practice.

Interventions: Participants developed initial diagnostic impressions after reviewing the chief complaint, nurse triage notes, and vital signs. Tests were then selected, and a final diagnostic impression was identified after results were known. Clinicians also marked a visual analog scale corresponding to their estimate that each diagnostic possibility was correct. Results: Experienced physicians increased their certainty more than novices (P = .014). They deviated from a standard history-physical-laboratory sequence more often than novices (P = .008).

	abstract = {Background                   Metacognition is a cognitive process that involves self-awareness of thinking, understanding, and performance. This study assesses pathologists’ metacognition by examining the association between their diagnostic accuracy and self-reported confidence levels while interpreting skin and breast biopsies.                   Design                   We studied 187 pathologists from the Melanoma Pathology Study (M-Path) and 115 pathologists from the Breast Pathology Study (B-Path). We measured pathologists’ metacognitive ability by examining the area under the curve (AUC), the area under each pathologist’s receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve summarizing the association between confidence and diagnostic accuracy. We investigated possible relationships between this AUC measure, referred to as metacognitive sensitivity, and pathologist attributes. We also assessed whether higher metacognitive sensitivity affected the association between diagnostic accuracy and a secondary diagnostic action such as requesting a second opinion.                   Results                   We found no significant associations between pathologist clinical attributes and metacognitive AUC. However, we found that pathologists with higher AUC showed a stronger trend to request secondary diagnostic action for inaccurate diagnoses and not for accurate diagnoses compared with pathologists with lower AUC.                   Limitations                   Pathologists reported confidence in specific diagnostic terms, rather than the broader classes into which the diagnostic terms were later grouped to determine accuracy. In addition, while there is no gold standard for the correct diagnosis to determine the accuracy of pathologists’ interpretations, our studies achieved a high-quality reference diagnosis by using the consensus diagnosis of 3 experienced pathologists.                   Conclusions                   Metacognition can affect clinical decisions. If pathologists have self-awareness that their diagnosis may be inaccurate, they can request additional tests or second opinions, providing the opportunity to correct inaccurate diagnoses.                   Highlights                   Metacognitive sensitivity varied across pathologists, with most showing higher sensitivity than expected by chance. None of the demographic or clinical characteristics we examined was significantly associated with metacognitive sensitivity. Pathologists with higher metacognitive sensitivity were more likely to request additional tests or second opinions for their inaccurate diagnoses.},

DESIGN: Prospective, counterbalanced experimental design. SETTING: Laboratory study conducted under controlled conditions at three academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two senior medical students, 72 senior medical residents, and 72 faculty internists. INTERVENTION: We created highly detailed, 2-to 4-page synopses of 36 diagnostically challenging medical cases, each with a definitive correct diagnosis. Subjects generated a differential diagnosis for each of 9 assigned cases, and indicated their level of confidence in each diagnosis.     MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A differential was considered ‘‘correct’’ if the clinically true diagnosis was listed in that subject’s hypothesis list. To assess confidence, subjects rated the likelihood that they would, at the time they generated the differential, seek assistance in reaching a diagnosis. Subjects’ confidence and correctness were ‘‘mildly’’ aligned (k =.314 for all subjects, .285 for faculty, .227 for residents, and .349 for students). Residents were overconfident in 41\% of cases where their confidence and correctness were not aligned, whereas faculty were overconfident in 36\% of such cases and students in 25\%.     CONCLUSIONS: Even experienced clinicians may be unaware of the correctness of their diagnoses at the time they make them. Medical decision support systems, and other interventions designed to reduce medical errors, cannot rely exclusively on clinicians’ perceptions of their needs for such support.},

In a mixed-method design, a metacognitive calibration selfassessing (MCC) survey tool was applied to HFPS (n = 80, 20 teams of 6 medical students) and semistructured interviews were conducted with faculty (n = 5). When scored by faculty with a rubric, the mean student accuracy ranged from 23\% to 74\%, whereas their self-assessment of conﬁdence ranged from 71\% to 86\%. This result revealed overconﬁdence bias in novice students regarding the correctness of their wrong responses. The most common misconception identiﬁed was inverting cause and effect: metabolic acidosis was pointed to as the cause of the patient’s problems rather than a consequence of untreated diabetes mellitus. The most common treatment error was overtreatment, with unnecessary added medication. Interviews with faculty suggested that the MCC tool improved the team process by slowing students down, requiring them to think through their answers, and that overall the tool improved their critical thinking. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using a metacognitive conﬁdence calibration tool to assist novice students in learning safely to make deliberate diagnostic reasoning and decisions on patient care in real time during complex simulations while observing objectively their levels of psychological conﬁdence against patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Context                   The ability to self‐monitor one's performance in clinical settings is a critical determinant of safe and effective practice. Various studies have shown this form of self‐regulation to be more trustworthy than aggregate judgements (i.e. self‐assessments) of one's capacity in a given domain. However, little is known regarding what cues inform learners’ self‐monitoring, which limits an informed exploration of interventions that might facilitate improvements in self‐monitoring capacity. The purpose of this study is to understand the influence of characteristics of the individual (e.g. ability) and characteristics of the problem (e.g. case difficulty) on the accuracy of self‐monitoring by medical students.                   Methods                   In a cross‐sectional study, 283 medical students from 5 years of study completed a computer‐based clinical reasoning exercise. Confidence ratings were collected after completing each of six cases and the accuracy of self‐monitoring was considered to be a function of confidence when the eventual answer was correct relative to when the eventual answer was incorrect. The magnitude of that difference was then explored as a function of year of seniority, gender, case difficulty and overall aptitude.                   Results                     Students demonstrated accurate self‐monitoring by virtue of giving higher confidence ratings (57.3\%) and taking a shorter time to work through cases (25.6 seconds) when their answers were correct relative to when they were wrong (41.8\% and 52.0 seconds, respectively; p{\textless} 0.001 and                     d                      {\textgreater} 0.5 in both instances). Self‐monitoring indices were related to student seniority and case difficulty, but not to overall ability or student gender.                   Conclusions                   This study suggests that the accuracy of self‐monitoring is context specific, being heavily influenced by the struggles students experience with a particular case rather than reflecting a generic ability to know when one is right or wrong. That said, the apparent capacity to self‐monitor increases developmentally because increasing experience provides a greater likelihood of success with presented problems.               ,                  The struggles students experience with a particular case are shown to have considerable influence on self‐monitoring accuracy, suggesting this competence to be context specific.},

	abstract = {Background: Information distortion suggests that people change the evaluation of new information to support an emerging belief. The present study was designed to measure the extent to which physicians distort incoming medical information to support an emerging diagnosis. Design: Data were collected via an anonymous questionnaire. The experimental group (102 physicians) read 3 patient scenarios, each with 2 competing diagnoses. Physicians first read information that favored 1 of the 2 diagnoses (the “steer”). They then rated a series of neutral cues that favored neither diagnosis. At each cue presentation, respondents rated the extent to which cues favored either diagnosis and updated the strength of their diagnostic belief. After the neutral cues in the third scenario, respondents rated cues that opposed the initial steer. A control group (36 physicians) rated all the cues in random order and not within scenarios, thus providing unbiased baseline ratings for calculating distortion in the experimental group. Results: Distortion was statistically significant ( P {\textless} 0.001) and was associated with the strength of belief in the leading diagnosis. Physicians with over 10 years in practice distorted less than their less experienced counterparts ([Formula: see text] = 1.04 v. [Formula: see text] = 1.78, P {\textless} 0.05). Having developed an initial diagnostic leaning consistent with the steer, 56\% of physicians remained committed to it after receiving the conflicting cues. Distortion was strongly associated with commitment to the steer (odds ratio, 1.4; 95\% confidence interval, 1.03–1.79; P = 0.03). Limitations: Physicians did not elicit information; therefore, the authors cannot estimate the size of distortion in tasks involving information search. Conclusions: Distortion could partly explain commitment of physicians to an early diagnosis. Both distortion and strength of initial diagnostic belief seem to decline after 10 years in family medicine.},

	abstract = {Previous research has highlighted the importance of physicians’ early hypotheses for their subsequent diagnostic decisions. It has also been shown that diagnostic accuracy improves when physicians are presented with a list of diagnostic suggestions to consider at the start of the clinical encounter. The psychological mechanisms underlying this improvement in accuracy are hypothesised. It is possible that the provision of diagnostic suggestions disrupts physicians’ intuitive thinking and reduces their certainty in their initial diagnostic hypotheses. This may encourage them to seek more information before reaching a diagnostic conclusion, evaluate this information more objectively, and be more open to changing their initial hypotheses. Three online experiments explored the effects of early diagnostic suggestions, provided by a hypothetical decision aid, on different aspects of the diagnostic reasoning process. Family physicians assessed up to two patient scenarios with and without suggestions. We measured effects on certainty about the initial diagnosis, information search and evaluation, and frequency of diagnostic changes. We did not find a clear and consistent effect of suggestions and detected mainly non-significant trends, some in the expected direction. We also detected a potential biasing effect: when the most likely diagnosis was included in the list of suggestions (vs. not included), physicians who gave that diagnosis initially, tended to request less information, evaluate it as more supportive of their diagnosis, become more certain about it, and change it less frequently when encountering new but ambiguous information; in other words, they seemed to validate rather than question their initial hypothesis. We conclude that further research using different methodologies and more realistic experimental situations is required to uncover both the beneficial and biasing effects of early diagnostic suggestions.},

	abstract = {Background                   Diagnostic reasoning requires clinicians to think through complex uncertainties. We tested the possibility of a bias toward an available single diagnosis in uncertain cases.                   Design                   We developed 5 different surveys providing a succinct description of a hypothetical individual patient scenaric. Each scenario was formulated in 2 versions randomized to participants, with the versions differing only in whether an alternative diagnosis was present or absent. The 5 scenarios were designed as separate tests of robustness using diverse cases, including a cautious scenario, a risky scenario, a sophisticated scenario, a validation scenario, and a comparative scenario (each survey containing only 1 version of 1 scenario). Participants included community members ( n = 1104) and health care professionals ( n = 200) who judged the chances of COVID infection in an individual patient.                   Results                   The first scenario described a cautious patient and found a 47\% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID when a flu diagnosis was present compared with absent (odds ratio = 0.53, 95\% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.94, P = 0.003). The second scenario described a less cautious patient and found a 70\% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID in the presence of a flu diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.30, 95\% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.70, P {\textless} 0.001). The third was a more sophisticated scenario presented to medical professionals and found a 73\% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID in the presence of a mononucleosis diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.27, 95\% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.75, P {\textless} 0.001). Two further scenarios—avoiding mention of population norms—replicated the results.                   Limitations                   Brief hypothetical scenarios may overestimate the extent of bias in more complicated medical situations.                   Conclusions                   These results demonstrate that an available simple diagnosis can lead individuals toward premature closure and a failure to fully consider additional severe diseases.                   Highlights                   Occum’s razor has been debated for centuries yet rarely subjected to experimental testing for evidence-based medicine. This article offers direct evidence that people favor an available simple diagnosis, thereby neglecting to consider additional serious diseases. The bias can lead individuals to mistakenly lower their judged likelihood of COVID or another disease when an alternate diagnosis is present. This misconception over the laws of probability appears in judgments by community members and by health care workers. The pitfall in reasoning extends to high-risk cases and is not easily attributed to information, incentives, or random chance.},

	abstract = {Many important real-world decision tasks involve the detection of rarely occurring targets (e.g., weapons in luggage, potentially cancerous abnormalities in radiographs). Over the past decade, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that extreme prevalence (both high and low) leads to an increase in errors. While this “prevalence effect” is well established, the cognitive and/or perceptual mechanisms responsible for it are not. One reason for this is that the most common tool for analyzing prevalence effects, Signal Detection Theory, cannot distinguish between different biases that might be present. Through an application to pathology image-based decisionmaking, we illustrate that an evidence accumulation modeling framework can be used to disentangle different types of biases. Importantly, our results show that prevalence influences both response expectancy and stimulus evaluation biases, with novices (students, N = 96) showing a more pronounced response expectancy bias and experts (medical laboratory professionals, N = 19) showing a more pronounced stimulus evaluation bias.},

	abstract = {Background: Misplaced or poorly calibrated confidence in healthcare professionals’ judgments compromises the quality of health care. Using higher fidelity clinical simulations to elicit clinicians’ confidence 'calibration' (i.e. overconfidence or underconfidence) in more realistic settings is a promising but underutilized tactic. In this study we examine nurses’ calibration of confidence with judgment accuracy for critical event risk assessment judgments in a high fidelity simulated clinical environment. The study also explores the effects of clinical experience, task difficulty and time pressure on the relationship between confidence and accuracy.     Methods: 63 student and 34 experienced nurses made dichotomous risk assessments on 25 scenarios simulated in a high fidelity clinical environment. Each nurse also assigned a score (0–100) reflecting the level of confidence in their judgments. Scenarios were derived from real patient cases and classified as easy or difficult judgment tasks. Nurses made half of their judgments under time pressure. Confidence calibration statistics were calculated and calibration curves generated.     Results: Nurse students were underconfident (mean over/underconfidence score −1.05) and experienced nurses overconfident (mean over/underconfidence score 6.56), P = 0.01. No significant differences in calibration and resolution were found between the two groups (P = 0.80 and P = 0.51, respectively). There was a significant interaction between time pressure and task difficulty on confidence (P = 0.008); time pressure increased confidence in easy cases but reduced confidence in difficult cases. Time pressure had no effect on confidence or accuracy. Judgment task difficulty impacted significantly on nurses’ judgmental accuracy and confidence. A 'hard-easy' effect was observed: nurses were overconfident in difficult judgments and underconfident in easy judgments.     Conclusion: Nurses were poorly calibrated when making risk assessment judgments in a high fidelity simulated setting. Nurses with more experience tended toward overconfidence. Whilst time pressure had little effect on calibration, nurses’ over/underconfidence varied significantly with the degree of task difficulty. More research is required to identify strategies to minimize such cognitive biases.},

Despite this, little is known about how nurses’ subjective conﬁdence is calibrated with the accuracy of their judgments.     Methods. A sample of 103 nursing students and 34 experienced nurses were exposed to 25 risk assessment vignettes. For each vignette they made dichotomous judgements of whether the patient in each scenario was at risk of a critical event, and assigned conﬁdence ratings (0–100) to their judgement calls. The clinical vignettes and judgement criteria were generated from real patient cases. The methodology of conﬁdence calibration was used to calculate calibration measures and generate calibration curves. Data were collected between March 2007 and January 2008. Findings. Experienced nurses were statistically signiﬁcantly more conﬁdent than students but no more accurate. Whilst students tended towards under-conﬁdence, experienced nurses were over-conﬁdent. Experienced nurses were no more calibrated than students. Experienced nurses were no better at discriminating between correct and incorrect judgements than students. These patterns were exacerbated when nurses and students were extremely over-conﬁdent or extremely under-conﬁdent.     Conclusion. Nurses were systematically biased towards over/under-conﬁdence in their critical event risk assessment judgements. In particular, experienced nurses were no better calibrated than their student counterparts; with student under-conﬁdence countered by experienced nurses’ greater susceptibility to over-conﬁdence.},

	abstract = {Background: The primary aim of this study is to understand more about the perceptual-cognitive mechanisms underpinning the expert advantage in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation. While research has examined visual search processes in other aspects of medical decision making (e.g., radiology), this is the first study to apply the paradigm to ECG interpretation. The secondary aim is to explore the role that clinical history plays in influencing visual search behavior and diagnostic decision making. While clinical history may aid diagnostic decision making, it may also bias the visual search process. Methods: Ten final-year medical students and 10 consultant emergency medics were presented with 16 ECG traces (8 with clinical history that was not manipulated independently of case) while wearing eye tracking equipment. The ECGs represented common abnormalities encountered in emergency departments and were among those taught to final-year medical students. Participants were asked to make a diagnosis on each presented trace and report their level of diagnostic confidence. Results: Experts made significantly faster, more accurate, and more confident diagnoses, and this advantage was underpinned by differences in visual search behavior. Specifically, experts were significantly quicker at locating the leads of critical importance. Contrary to our hypothesis, clinical history had no significant effect on the readers’ ability to detect the abnormality or make an accurate diagnosis. Conclusions: Accurate ECG interpretation appears dependent on the perceptual skill of pattern recognition and specifically the time to fixate the critical lead(s). Therefore, there is potential clinical utility in developing perceptual training programs to train novices to detect abnormalities more effectively.},
