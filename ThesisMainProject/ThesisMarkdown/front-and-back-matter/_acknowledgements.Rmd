I would firstly like to thank my amazing supervisors, Nick and Helen, for your insights, patience, enthusiasm and boundless knowledge that helped shape this thesis into what it is. 

I also would like to thank my mother, father and sister for everything they have done for me, which would require more words to list off than there are contained in this thesis. 

I dedicate this to my grandparents.
