\section{Calibration of Confidence to Alternative Accuracy
Measures}\label{calibration-of-confidence-to-alternative-accuracy-measures}

\subsection{Differential Accuracy}\label{differential-accuracy}

When comparing Differential Accuracy (if a correct differential is
provided in the participant's list) to Confidence, we find, across
stages, participants' Confidence was not aligned to their Accuracy.
Instead, we find evidence of underconfidence at all stages. There was
evidence of a significant difference between the two at the Patient
History (t(84) = 8.24, MDiff = 0.24, p = 0), Physical Examination stage
(t(84) = -9.09, MDiff = -0.25, p = 0), and Testing stage (t(84) = -7.74,
MDiff = -0.22, p = 0).

In order to examine the observed underconfidence in more detail, we
compare confidence and Differential Accuracy by case (the mean values of
which can be found in Table 1 of the main thesis). We conducted paired
t-tests for each condition's cases by comparing Differential Accuracy
and confidence values (at the final Testing stage) to observe if they
significantly differ from each other. A p value of less than .05 is
interpreted as evidence for overconfidence or underconfidence (depending
on the direction of the effect). We observed underconfidence for the GBS
case (t(84) = -7.43, MDiff = -0.39, p = \textless{} .001), the TA case
(t(84) = -5.07, MDiff = -0.25, p = \textless{} .001), the TTP case
(t(84) = -3.23, MDiff = -0.2, p = \textless{} .001) and the UC case
(t(82) = -14.83, MDiff = -0.38, p = \textless{} .001). The remaining
cases did not yield a significant effect.

\subsection{Highest Likelihood
Accuracy}\label{highest-likelihood-accuracy}

When comparing Highest Likelihood Accuracy (likelihood assigned to the
highest likelihood differential if it is correct) to Confidence, we
find, across stages, participants' Confidence was not aligned to their
Accuracy. Instead, we find evidence of overconfidence at all stages.
There was evidence of a significant difference between the two at the
Patient History (t(84) = -2.49, MDiff = -0.05, p = 0.01), Physical
Examination stages (t(84) = 4.45, MDiff = 0.09, p = 0), and Testing
stage (t(84) = 6.84, MDiff = 0.16, p = 0).

In order to examine the observed overconfidence in more detail, we
compare confidence and Highest Likelihood Accuracy by case (the mean
values of which can be found in Table 1 of the main thesis). We
conducted paired t-tests for each condition's cases by comparing Highest
Likelihood Accuracy and confidence values (at the final Testing stage)
to observe if they significantly differ from each other. A p value of
less than .05 is interpreted as evidence for overconfidence or
underconfidence (depending on the direction of the effect). We observed
overconfidence for the AD case (t(84) = 8.92, MDiff = 0.37, p =
\textless{} .001), the MTB case (t(83) = 7.66, MDiff = 0.35, p =
\textless{} .001) and the TTP case (t(84) = 4.09, MDiff = 0.21, p =
\textless{} .001). The remaining cases did not yield a significant
effect.

are not answered by responses to the main questions.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    What's your general approach to making diagnoses? \emph{Follow-Up:}
    Do you have those cognitive aids or frameworks you use?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Do you tend to keep a broad set of differentials in mind?
    \emph{Follow-Up:} Are there particular situations where having a
    narrower set would be more useful?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \tightlist
  \item
    How do you decide what information or tests to get on a patient?
    \emph{Follow-Up:} Would you say you tend to seek information to
    confirm or to rule out differentials that you have in mind?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \tightlist
  \item
    How similar was your diagnostic reasoning on this task versus how
    you would approach diagnosis in real life? \emph{Follow-Up:} Was
    there anything that prevented you from approaching the task as you
    would in real life?
