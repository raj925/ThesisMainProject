Decisions within healthcare are unique within the wider realm of decision making. They are often made within high-pressure situations and have severe consequences if done so incorrectly. Hence, they require intensive training and a wide knowledge base for clinical staff to draw from. What is remarkable is that despite the intimidating amount of material for medical students to learn and the pressures that can befall them in their everyday line of work, as well as an ever-expanding understanding of medical conditions, treatment methods and technology to maintain, clinicians frequently make swift and accurate decisions that can have a profound impact on patientsâ€™ lives. When seeking to apply past research within decision making to an applied context, medicine is an interesting domain to study decision making, especially if findings can inform the training of the newer medical students. In particular, there is a need for the teaching and assessment of non-technical skills and human factors in healthcare (Higham et al, 2019), which is currently not addressed in a widespread standardised manner in speciality curricula (Grieg, Higham & Vaux, 2015). Similarly, curricula within medicine place little emphasis on how uncertainty is communicated and approached in medical decision making (Hall, 2002). Hence, this research looks into non-technical skills such as communication of confidence, management of uncertainty and mental model alignment. Over the course of this thesis, we will look at confidence and information seeking in general decision making and then apply insights from cognitive psychology to the realm of medicine.
