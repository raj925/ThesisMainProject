ICU Reflective

Presented here is a reflective chapter that contextualises the findings from this thesis within a real-world medical setting, namely that of Intensive Care. The account presented here is based on observations during multiple handovers and ward rounds at an intensive care unit, as well as discussions with staff working at the unit.

Firstly, some context is required for an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as a medical setting. ICU is first and foremost a support unit that is relatively agnostic with regards to medical subdisciplines. The primary aim of the unit is to provide ongoing care for acutely unwell patients in a supportive capacity rather than a remedial one. Hence, clinicians and nurses in ICU are limited in what they can do for patients in their care. ICU can be hugely beneficial for patients by providing urgent care for patients in hopes of aiding their road to recovery. Patients then tend to move elsewhere in the hospital, such as the main ward or to theatre for surgical intervention. As mentioned earlier, ICU sits outside of other medical subdisciplines. It is hence very frequent that individuals working in ICU are required to bring in external advice from other departments in the hospital, such as Rheumatology, Neurology, Surgery, Vascular or Trauma. ICU can hence act as a central coordinator of several decision makers who are involved with a particular patient’s care whilst clinicians within ICU itself will not be able to do too much without the involvement of these other departments whilst still having primary responsibility for that patient whilst they are in the unit. As one clinician put it, “someone who has trauma is longer Trauma’s responsibility.” In brief, ICU is usually a point of transition for patients within their medical pathway through the hospital, with other departments feeding into and being fed from ICU. But ICU can also be the last point in their patient journey (either positively or negatively).

ICU is then a department that involves many individuals, both from within and outside its remit. A key tenet is then quickly and temporarily formed teams that have to collaborate on a patient and align their mental models. It is very common for teams of individuals to work together despite having little to no prior experience with each other.

Perhaps the most focal decisions that consultants within ICU have to do with monitoring ICU capacity in the present and in the future. Every ICU unit has a limited capacity in terms of the number of beds available and hence the number of patients who can be cared for at any given time (this was 22 beds for the unit observed). A patient is able to leave ICU and hence free up a bed if they either improve enough to transition to another in the hospital or if they unfortunately die in ICU. However, because ICU is merely a support unit, patients can also find themselves in a longer period of little change where they neither improve or deteriorate significantly. As a result, patients can sometimes stay in ICU for weeks or even months on end. Clinicians and nurses in ICU have to balance what they can realistically do for a patient within their remit whilst being cognizant of the longer term outcome of the patient. This is best summed up by one clinician who said during observations: “there is balance of what we can do and what is kind (to the patient).”

Making decisions about the current and future capacity of ICU is hence extremely complex, as it involves an understanding of each patient’s condition not only in the current moment but in the future. Essentially, how likely is the patient to improve or deteriorate? There is a projection of future state that occurs. This occurs at the individual patient level, where clinicians imagine how well/unwell a patient will be in the short or long term future. This involves looking at the trend of treatment and what the upcoming milestone/endpoint for that patient might be. This can include simply getting the patient to eat solid food again or get up from their bed, or it could be tied to specific patient parameters (e.g. raise blood sugar to above 4). This projection also occurs at the unit level though, as the combination of each patient’s situation produces an overall picture of the unit’s available capacity to admit new patients. Finally, the projection can also take place over the entire trust/region. During observations, the start of a morning shift began with the announcement that there was ‘no capacity across the trust’, meaning any incoming requests from other departments to admit patients to ICU would have to be refused.  

These issues to do with capacity are of course related to actions of those in ICU but are also inexorably linked to wider environmental factors. This includes funding for increased ICU capacity and staffing as well as structural or technological issues within the hospital and region/trust as a whole. During one of our observation sessions, the unit was understaffed relative to the required number of staff needed to manage the unit. While these observations took place in the UK within the wider context of the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), environmental factors will look very different in other countries, especially those less economically developed. There are even aspects of Human Factors at play. In our observations, the ICU unit was split over two floors that each had their own consultant to manage them, which would likely be different to if all beds were on a single floor. These other environmental factors are outside of the scope of this thesis and will be briefly revisited at the end of this chapter.

Part of ICU’s coordination with other departments are incoming requests for the admitting of new patients. This could include a patient who has experienced a complication during surgery or a patient who has been admitted from an outside hospital in need of urgent care. Capacity is constantly at a premium and it becomes the forefront of an ICU consultant’s thinking. Ideally, the unit should be able to operate with a spare buffer capacity of one or two beds in case of an emergency. This spare capacity can be fairly rare to obtain however, as it can be due to factors outside of the control of ICU clinicians.

Decision making here is hence extremely difficult and high-pressure. Decisions have to be made of when to admit patients and when patients are likely to be discharged. What underscores these decisions is the likelihood of a patient realistically improving within ICU. There is only so much that ICU can do to help a patient who may be past the point of recovery. This demonstrates the aforementioned balance of what can be done and “what is kind.” These kinds of decisions are difficult to make for everyone, be it the clinicians in ICU or the patient’s next of kin. Being realistic about a patient’s prospects is incredibly hard but is required in order to adequately manage the ICU’s capacity in the future.

There can be diagnostic uncertainty for patients around what pathophysiologically may be driving their current set of symptoms. However, the real uncertainty stems not from the patient’s condition now, but the patient’s condition in the future, such as in 24 hours or 48 hours time. An ICU consultant may consider the following questions:

* How bad ‘could’ this patient’s condition be relative to how unwell the patient is now?
* What realistic milestones/goals can we set for this patient’s recovery plan?
* Is the patient ‘wardable’? (i.e. is the patient well enough to be discharged from ICU and sent to the main hospital ward for continued care that is not as acute)

The state of a patient can change fairly quickly as a sudden development in their situation can occur over a single shift. This is why, at least in the unit that we observed, there is a regular communication cadence between individuals working in ICU. This comprises a morning handover, where the consultant during the night shift hands over to the morning shift consultant and reports patient developments that occurred during the night. This also comprises morning, afternoon and evening ward rounds, during which consultants visit each patient bed to receive updates on the patient by the caring nurses and (when possible) talk to the patient. During these ward rounds, the consultant will collaborate with the registrar, nurses and any individuals from other relevant departments to formally record an assessment of the patient and recommend a short term action plan to be taken for that patient to be coordinated with the attending nurses. This includes a formal assessment of whether the patient is “clinically fit for Critical Care Discharge'' (wording taken from the computerised system used to record ward round documentation during observations). During observations, these ward rounds took several hours due to the amount of detail and attention afforded to each patient but this can vary depending on the consultant and the unit. 

We shall now look at how the research questions within this thesis relate to the setting of ICU. On confidence,
