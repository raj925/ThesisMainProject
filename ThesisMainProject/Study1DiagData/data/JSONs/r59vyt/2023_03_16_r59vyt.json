hone in on the diagnosis with those buzzwords.\n\nAlternatively, whether those with more clinical experience will use investigations more sparingly.","DiagnosticApproach":"I try to start with a long list of differentials based on the presenting complaint. Then narrow those down with the examination. Then use investigations to confirm / rule out diagnoses.\n\nIn practice, I am guided by the history to the most likely diagnosis then use the exam and investigations to confirm it / pick up other diagnoses I'd forgotten to consider.","Feedback":"I kept forgetting the history, then when I tried to go back to reread the history, the quiz had already moved onto the examination section and the tests tab was available. It would be useful if once a piece of information was revealed it was displayed on the 'differentials' page so you could recall it better (it's a lot harder to retain information displayed for a few seconds on a screen than it is to remember something a patient has told you in real life)"}}}
